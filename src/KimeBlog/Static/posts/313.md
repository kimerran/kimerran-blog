"<i>One programming language per year</i>" - I told myself (but only recently). If I did this since I was at grade school, then I should've master several programming languages already.

1\. BASIC, VB6, VB.NET (basic guy, yes.)<br/>
2\. PHP<br/>
3\. C#<br/>
4\. JavaScript<br/>
5\. __What's next?__

###Hello, Ruby!
Last week I tried to re-read some Ruby books (as I did already some time last year) and tried to create a [parser][1] for [KimeBlog][2]. It's a script I use to generate all.json files based on the list of post files.

###Hi, Ruby on Rails
As someone with background of ASP.NET MVC, I can say developing apps using Ruby on Rails is faster because of it's 'conventions'. I am now building my first app using Rails to learn it faster. One great source you can check to learn Rails is it's [guide][3].

###Running the 'train' on Rails
You can easily debug Rails application by running '__rails s__'. But a no-no in production. You should deploy it to a real web server just like what I did with [nginx][4].

Will let you know after I finish my first rails app.
