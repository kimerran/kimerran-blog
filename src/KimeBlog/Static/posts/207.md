# the kimerran logs - Starting on 24th.

published: Jul 30, 2012

I have been blogging since 2009 and have transferred from one to another blogging platforms. My first blog was on Live Journal which started when I was an intern at Pfizer out of curiosity. I transferred to Blogger at some time when I saw that most people create their blogs from their and transferred to Tumblr when people have started creating them too. I started to try out Word Press around 2010 but for some reason I got back to Blogger which I used for quite some time.

What I usually blogs are personal and often written in my local language which is Filipino. I also write posts about some technical subjects like certification, programming, gadgets and tech tips which results from me being an IT guy.

On September 2011, a book about the stock market and personal finance led me to opening Pera Atbp (Money Etcetera) and created a personal finance blog at www.peratbp.com. My friend Reman and I have written articles about personal finance, self-help, motivational and book reviews as well. It is hosted at Blogger since day one. I also bought theadunetwork.com after a month which is a website for the facebook fanpage â€“ The Adamson Network.

I thought Blogger was the best platform for blogging until Nick, the creator of Mutual Fund Philippine (mutualfundphilippines.com) told me that I should try self-hosted WordPress. I found it better than Blogger and have never turned back ever. I renamed my personal finance blog Money Gizmo as it was supposed to contain posts from Pera Atbp and also the technical posts from my other blog.

Since then I have used WordPress for my other blogs and websites. I have created Meme Tees T-shirts (memetees.ph), JPCS-AdU (jpcs-adu.com), ASA-AdU (asa-adu.com), Adamsonian (adamsonian.ph) and COMX.PH (comx.ph) from WordPress. Even this blog is created from WordPress.

I am opening MarkHughNeri.com as my personal blog from now on. I am opening this on my 24th birthday.

So, who am I?

I am Mark Hugh Neri. I am an IT professional since the time I started working. I have experience in software development and systems administration and support. I am certified in Windows 7 and ITIL v3 Foundations.

I took my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Adamson University Cum Laude. I was able to finish my studies being an Academic Scholar. I was an active student leader and was President of the Academic Scholars Alliance of Adamson University and Adamson Computer Engineering Society. I also co-founded Junior Philippine Computer Society â€“ Adamson Chapter.

At present I am working as a software engineer from a multinational IT company. I love technology and how it makes our lives easier. I love to learn and study new things. I love to share ideas on the internet and in reality (I am a frustrated teacher).

I am good at organizing events especially activities that brings help and care to other people. I am a music lover and have composed several songs as well. I think of business most of the time. I have this goal of being financial free as fast as possible. I am slowly building relationship with the Lord. I am a big brother, son, lover, friend and a 'guy-next-door' helper.

I have this dream of turning Philippines (my home country) to a better place to live in. To taste the world's most delicious cuisine. To visit the world's unique people, places and culture. To share my knowledge about the latest news about technology and how it should work for you. And many other things that I am yet to discover. So, join me on this journey as I officially open this diary. As my twitter line goes â€“ 'Do Something Extraordinary!'.
