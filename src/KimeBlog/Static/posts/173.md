# the kimerran logs - Chowking Chao Fan

published: Jun 23, 2012

When I want to eat at Chow King, it is most likely that their Chao Fan would be my order. I don't now but Â I liked the taste â€“ rice plus siomai. Their Combo A would be the best deal but as of today, they don't offer it anymore. Combo A is just Pork Chao Fan with 3 piece siomai.Â I want mine spicy, mixed with their chili-garlic with soy sauce while Trisha just wants the toyo-mansi. Yum! ![:\)][1]
