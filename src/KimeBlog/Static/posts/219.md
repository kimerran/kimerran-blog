# the kimerran logs - Original Bibingka At Bibingkinitan

published: Sep 9, 2012

You will definitely buy again when you started munching on this very Pinoy snack. Priced at 20-25 pesos per piece, you will be tempted to buy a dozen bibingka the next time you see their stalls at many malls inside and outside Metro Manila.

Even without tasting it, once I smelled the aroma of their original bibingka, I already bought another box so everyone at home can taste it.

Bibingkinitan is the biggest bibingka and coffee chain popularized by variety of soft and moist bibingka and kapeng barako (Philippine Liberica). It was established in 2006 and has been an innovator during the time when burgers and donuts are popular in the Philippine market.

## What is Bibingka?

Bibingka is a type of rice cake native to the Philippines. This is traditionally made from galapong (milled glutinous rice), coconut milk, margarine, and sugar. During dawn masses on Christmas season, side street vendors are a common sight preparing and selling this delicious rice cake along with "puto bumbong".
