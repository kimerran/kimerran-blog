Verse 1:<br/>
You always neglect me<br/>
Wishing I'm not here<br/>
You always ignore me<br/>
Wishing I was dead<br/>

Refrain:<br/>
You keep on pushing me far away<br/>
You don't care what I say<br/>
No matter how I tried<br/>
All my efforts were denied<br/>
But now I'll show you<br/>

Chorus:<br/>
Watch me watch me<br/>
As I traverse this sound<br/>
Do you love me?<br/>
You can tell me now<br/>
'Cause I don't want this dream to ever end<br/>
And I don't want you to keep on hanging on<br/>
'Cause you know I love you so<br/>

Verse 2:<br/>
I keep on waving goodbyes<br/>
Keep on bidding goodnights<br/>
But I swear as I say this<br/>
Hello and I miss you so<br/>

(Repeat Refrain)<br/>
(Repeat Chorus as many as you want)<br/>
