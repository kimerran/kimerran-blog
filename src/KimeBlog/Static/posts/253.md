# the kimerran logs - Happy Birthday Trisha!

published: Mar 30, 2013

It's Trisha's 24th birthday yesterday! I brought my siblings with me, Jekjek and Glyza. Watched some comedy and horror films. Ate spag, friend chicken, ice cream and cake. Guess what? It's also Maundy Thursday. Still Happy Birthday! More years to come and more years to celebrate!

Trisha's Birthday Cake

On the other side of the news, I just created another SEO experiment â€“ [Volets Resort Reviews][3]. Good thing we will have some splashing on first week of April and I'll have the necessary information for the site. Was also doing some initial works at internet.gizmoblogr.com.

Tomorrow I'll have the 3 GC's of beer in-cans redeemed. Then will sell it for profit. Also planning for our summer splash on the first week of April. Let's hope there's sun and everything goes okay. ![:\)][1]
