# Show Me Your Windows 8.1 Desktop

I guess I might go back to my programming once I'm done fixing my laptop. I have already installed back my development tools and updated to Windows 8.1 which is quite good.

Things I like about the update:

* The 'small' tile size since I can put more applications on a little screen
* SkyDrive built-in. No need to install the desktop application.
* And the START button is back! No more clicking on the imaginary button on the lower left portion of the screen
* Installation of new applications doesn't make a pinned short cut to the start screen automatically.

So, here's my neatly organized Windows 8.1 start screen, show me yours. Click for a larger version.
