# the kimerran logs - 1st Week of October 2012

published: Oct 7, 2012

Hello October! Only a few months before the Christmas season. So, as usual I had a busy week again. My everyday routine was waking up at around 10 or 11 in the morning, then have lunch (actually brunch) then go on-line for 30-60 minutes, then prepare for work and then travel to work, then work from 3 in the afternoon until 12 midnight. I'll be home at around 1-2 in the morning. Sometimes when I am not yet sleepy, I would watch either a movie, a training video or read some book(s).

I guess that will be my routine for some time now since I want to learn more about what I am doing right now and I want to learn fast since technology really evolves fast and you will be left out if you don't struggle to keep updated.

I also created a blog post about me being a [.NET developer][1] today, went to the mall to buy some groceries and ate spaghetti for merienda. Had a great Sunday afternoon and ready for another stressful week! Aja!
