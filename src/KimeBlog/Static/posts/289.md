# A Simple Threading Example in .NET

Have you ever encountered an application that display a 'Not Responding' message on the title bar? Or do you have an application that appears to 'hang' when it does something for a very long period of time?

If your answer is YES to both questions, then you might want to check this example. Threading is one solution (currently not the BEST) you may use for both problems above. It enables your application to stay responsive and interactive even when it is doing something that could take a while to finish such as file reading, database connectivity, complex computation, etc.

So, here's a very simple example of using Threading in C#. Please go ahead and open a new Console application project before proceeding to the first step.

1\. Include System.Threading namespace

2\. Create a new Thread object. It requires you to pass a ThreadStart object which again requires you to pass the method name of the task the thread will execute.

In our example, we simulate a task that takes a while to execute in the VeryLongTask method. This method just display numbers from 1 to 10 and pauses for 2 seconds on every number. Take note that you should pass either a STATIC or INSTANCE method.

3\. Now, let's start the thread by calling the Start method from the thread we created. Also note where we put the method to display the message "Thread started!".

4\. Let's run the program by pressing F5 inside Visual Studio. Notice that the message "Thread started!" appears even before the counting finished. It is because the main thread handles that while another thread does the counting.

Here's the complete code:

using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading; namespace ThreadingExample { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Thread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(VeryLongTask)); Console.WriteLine("Starting the thread..."); t.Start(); // starts the thread Console.WriteLine("Thread started!"); Console.Read(); } private static void VeryLongTask() { for (int i = 1; i
