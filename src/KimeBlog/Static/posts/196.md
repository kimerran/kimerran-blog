# the kimerran logs - Buko Farm Coco Manga Shake

published: Jul 25, 2012

Have you tried the new hype â€“ [Buko Shake][1]? I did and this drink's as addictive as Milk Teas. How about adding some Mangoes in the drink? Well, Buko Farm did by offering their Coco Manga Shake.

The flavor is good but the tiny bits of coconut makes the drinking experience a bit odd. Why not try it? They're offered at Greeks Shawarma as well.
