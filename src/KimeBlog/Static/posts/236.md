# the kimerran logs - Maxâ€™s Restaurant â€“ Chicken and Lumpia Rolls

published: Dec 10, 2012

Yesterday I attended a Christmas Party of First Food Link held at Max's Restaurant â€“ Quezon Avenue branch. I was invited by my girlfriend since her father is also a member of the said direct-selling company. First Food Link is a direct-selling company that sells processed meat products such as embotido, longganisa, ham, bacon, sausages and many more. They are also offering food carts as 'Sulit Pinoy Food Carts'. To know more about the company, visit their website at firstfoodlink.com.

The party started with a talk from the company's president and shared the members a new opportunity to bring their businesses to a higher level.

I also saw Kath De Castro who is also a member of First Food Link.Â There are a lot of prizes that everyone was able to take home at least one. The grand prize is a brand new flat screen television.

Of course, the party will not be complete without the food. They served Max's chicken and lumpia rolls for dinner. Trisha definitely love this food combination. She loves chicken and as well as lumpiang shanghai.

Trisha taught me to mixÂ worcestershire sauce and ketchup and it is really delicious. It's a good dip for Max's Chicken and the lumpiang shanghai too. If you don't believe me, it's worth trying out and taste for yourself.

The party was held at Max's Restaurant at Quezon Avenue. It was hosted by First Food Link Philippines. Personal thanks to Trisha's parents for inviting me to their Christmas Party. Looking forward to attending the next Christmas party because they will be showcasing more prizes.
