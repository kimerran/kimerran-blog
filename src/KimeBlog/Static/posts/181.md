# the kimerran logs - KFC Cheese On Top Burger

published: Jul 5, 2012

Awkward. I will not buy the same thing again from KFC. It's just an ordinary Chicken Burger with cheese on top. The cheese looks painfully cheap and something you won't eat. Like a plastic wrapper. I am expecting something like from the McDo Cheeseburger. Oh well, here's what you get for your 50 pesos. Not totally worth it!
