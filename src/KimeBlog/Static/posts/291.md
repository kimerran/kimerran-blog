# Simple .NET Database Tutorial using ADO.NET (Preparation)

Today I will be showing you how simple it is to create a .NET application that communicates with a database using ADO.NET. This will be a five-part series. I will show you how you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to a SQL Server.

First, we need to create the database that we will use throughout the tutorial. I am using [SQL Server 2012 Express with SQL Server Management Studio][1]. If you haven't installed it yet to your machine, I suggest you download it now so you can follow the instructions as we move along.

1\. Once you have installed SQL Server Express, connect to your server instance (by default it is SQLEXPRESS). Right click on Databases and select New Database. Set the name of your database and click on OK.

2\. Let's proceed in creating our first Table in the database. Right click on Tables from the database you created and click on New Table. Create the columns with their corresponding data types as shown below. We also set Id as our Primary Key and have it auto-generated for us. Save your table as Employee.

Id
int

Fullname
varchar(50)

Position
varchar(50)

EmployeeNumber
varchar(10)

Salary
int

Â 

3\. Let's add some sample records to our Employee table. You can do this by right-clicking the table and selecting Edit Top 200 Rows.

Â 

4\. To verify the records you have added, you can right-click on the table and choose Select Top 1000 Rows.

At this point we have prepared the database that we will use on the next part of this series. Here you have learned how to create a database, how to add a table to your database, how to add records to your table and how to verify if those records were successfully added.

Next part will be [How to perform a CREATE method using ADO.NET][7].
