# the kimerran logs - Chatime â€“ SM Manila

published: Jun 27, 2012

We thought it's going to taste terrible â€“ like tearible este teariffic but we are so wrong. We tried to check out Chatime at SM Manila.

We ordered their Strawberry Milktea which is one of the recommended (according to the poster). You can have one large for 90 pesos and 80 pesos for the regular.

What I like from the SM Manila branch is their comfortable chair and great looking design of the interior. Also, as compared to other milk tea shops, they just have too many drinks to choose from. They also have hot drinks.

We will come back to try more of their milk tea and other drinks! :)Â The interiors are just great! Way to relax and de-stress.

Chatime SM Manila Â - Now Open!Â Enjoyed our first Straberry Milktea
