# the kimerran logs - It takes a Man and a Woman

published: Apr 1, 2013

The first movie of John Lloyd and Sarah Geronimo which I watched in the cinema and probably the last. Nice romantic-comedy film and if you have watched the first two movies, then you better watch this one. It's also been a while since I did grocery for the family needs.

April 7 is a big day since I am planning to have a summer outing for the family, my close relatives and Trisha's family. Hope everything goes okay and within budget. ![:D][1]
