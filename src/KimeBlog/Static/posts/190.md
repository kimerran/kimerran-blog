# the kimerran logs - GongCha Milk Tea with Pearl Jelly

published: Jul 18, 2012

Since my first try with Gong Cha's milk teas, I always order [Wintermelon Milk Tea][1], this time I have tried their Milk Tea with Pearl Jelly variant. As usual, I am very satisfied with the taste.Â I paid 121 pesos for this one (delivery fee included).
