# DebugLog: XNA, Twilio, and NodeJS

![windows phone accelerator][1]![windows phone accelerator][2]For the very random stuffs but still related to technology (software development), I will be writing DebugLogs â€“ some sort of diary at least once per week. These logs will be more about random software development things such as new programming languages, technologies, device, or any stuff that I find interesting. So, here's the first one.

I am near the completion of my first Windows Phone XNA game that I started about 2 weeks ago. During the process of which I learned a lot of stuff. From the game logic, to sprites, to reading gestures from the touch screen, to creating several helper class (including something that determine the next coordinate in a circle), to playing background music and to getting data from the accelerometer. Things that I don't know about two weeks ago.

If you want to see a tutorial about Windows Phone XNA (simplified), let me know by commenting below and I'll create one for you.

[XNA is dead. Long live XNA. ][3]Yeah. Microsoft is dropping support for XNA. Still don't know what is going to replace it. But at least we know there are alternatives such as [MonoGame][4].

Want to create an SMS-app? Check out [Twilio ][5]\- a cloud API for your voice / SMS needs.


More things to check-out.

I am yet to check if any of these (especially the stylus) could work with ASP.NET MVC. Until next week.
