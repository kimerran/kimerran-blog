# the kimerran logs - I Received an E-mail

published: Feb 19, 2013

It's my first time to receive an e-mail from someone interested to post an ad on Money Gizmo. Hopefully we agree on the price. Looking forward to more partners in the blog and to all my future ideas. These ideas should become projects! I already told my girlfriend and some friends and their reaction is positive.

I just need time and effort for these. Prioritization of my future projects:

1\. Sisig Bytes â€“ the layout of the site is already done , I just need to edit the remaining posts and implement SEO. Food sub-site should be launched next week.

2\. Money Gizmo â€“ continue posting, hopefully my ad partner will agree on the price that I have set. I will transfer this to Blue Host on March â€“ April.

3\. Huffr/ Glugr â€“ multisite blogs targeting niche contents as well. slow building but long-term goal

4\. Eggxamr â€“ on pending. layout of plans and architecture. I plan to do this in ASP.NET.

5\. Hatcheet â€“ after eggxamr's successful release. I will also do this in ASP.NET
