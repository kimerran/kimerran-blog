# ASP.NET MVC Validation using Data Annotations

[Â Home][1]Â >Â [ASP.NET][2]Â >Â ASP.NET MVC Validation using Data Annotations

See, I am pretty new to ASP.NET MVC and to help me learn better, I've decided to create a simple database application called MyPriceDb. I am currently working on the user creation functionality. This is a basic page where an someone can create new users of the application.

This page will look similar to the one below. User will have to enter a login name, password and e-mail and as well as confirmation text boxes to avoid typo-errors. Of course, this will also have a anti-spam mechanism but that will not be part of this tutorial.

Â 

Since this is MVC, I cannot make use of [ASP.NET Validation Controls][5] such as RequiredFieldValidator, CompareValidator, RangeValidator, etc.

To have validations in ASP.NET MVC, we will make use of Data Annotations.

Continue reading below to know how.

1\. First, I've created a model of my database using LINQ to SQL classes and named it MyPriceDb.dbml. I have also added two more properties (which are not part of the table design for User) named ConfirmPass and ConfirmEmail and set data type to string.

Â 

2.Â If you haven't encountered data annotations yet, it is a way to describe your data or Â simply aÂ metadata. ReadÂ [MSDN article about Data Annotations][7]Â to learn more about data annotations. For example, login name of users should be minimum of 8 characters. Data annotations make it possible to describe these kind of properties on your code.

Usually, we put these attributes on the class definition of the entity itself, in this case, the User class. However, it might be difficult to put this on the original class since it is located under MyPriceDb.designer.vb which I believe is an auto-generated file (see picture below).

Â 

3\. To simplify things, I've created a new class called UserMetaData (line 7).Â And then, I've made the original entity class (User) to get the attributes of UserMetaData by using the code at line 3. These lines of code just tells ASP.NET that the class User follows the meta data description of the class UserMetaData.

Now, you can assign attributes to the metadata class as if you are applying them to the original User class. See example below.

Imports System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations  _ Partial Public Class User End Class Public Class UserMetaData    Public Property LoginName As String   Public Property LoginPass As String    Public Property ConfirmPass As String  Public Property Email As String   Public Property ConfirmEmail As String End Class

Imports System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations

Â 

 _

Partial Public Class User

End Class

Â 

Public Class UserMetaData

Â 

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Public Property LoginName As String

Â 

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Public Property LoginPass As String

Â 

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Public Property ConfirmPass As String

Â 

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Public Property Email As String

Â 

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Public Property ConfirmEmail As String

Â 

End Class

Â 

4\. Next step is to apply this on your views. First make sure that you have set the model of your view using the code below.

@ModelType MyPriceDb.User

@ModelType MyPriceDb.User

Â 

5\. Since I've set the model to be used on this particular view, I can use the following code below to output the label, input box and at the same time the validation message if at least one of the attributes from the data annotations has been violated.

@Html.LabelFor(Function(m) m.LoginName)  @Html.TextBoxFor(Function(m) m.LoginName) @Html.ValidationMessageFor(Function(m) m.LoginName)

Â Â Â Â @Html.LabelFor(Function(m) m.LoginName) 

Â Â Â Â @Html.TextBoxFor(Function(m) m.LoginName)

Â Â Â Â @Html.ValidationMessageFor(Function(m) m.LoginName)

Â 

6\. Finally, to check the validation, you can use the code below on your controller. However, please note that this is a server-side code and will require a full-page request for your validation to work.

If ModelState.IsValid Then ' Your code here End If

Â Â If ModelState.IsValid Then

Â Â Â Â  ' Your code here

Â Â End If

Â 

7\. To implement the same validation on the client-side, you have to call some JavaScripts. Add the following code snippet on your view normally before the  tag.

@Section Scripts   End Section

@Section Scripts

Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â 

End Section

Â 



Now, the validation in my in-progress ASP.NET MVC application is now in place using .NET Data Annotations. If you have questions or suggestions, please do comment below.
