Yes, contrary to the common belief that WordPress are only used for blogs, there are already a lot of sites that uses WordPress as a full-fledged Content Management System.

There are a lot of good reasons why you should choose to have a hosted WordPress blog and here are some of the many.

1\. Free hosting. Registering for a hosted WordPress blog is totally free. You don't have to buy a web hosting account from Blue Host or Hostgator or any top web hosting companies out there. All your files and database are kept in WordPress data centers.
