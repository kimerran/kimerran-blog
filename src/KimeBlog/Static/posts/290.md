# My New Way of Showing Tutorials Using Gif Recorder

[Â Home][1]Â >Â [Featured][2]Â >Â My New Way of Showing Tutorials Using Gif Recorder

We all know that KNOWLEDGE IS POWER and nowadays learning can be done in many ways. Some preferred traditional ways such as classroom learning and reading books while some preferred to do it the digital way â€“ articles and tutorials you can find ONLINE!

Personally I have learned a lot of stuffs from how to create your first WordPress site to preparing my favorite Adobo dish from the internet. I am a fan of tutorials and if you check my YouTube subscriptions, you will find that almost 80% are tutorial channels. And that's a reason why I put up my own blog to share some tutorials to those who wants to learn programming specifically .NET development.

Here in GizmoBlogr, I have used some of the common techniques in providing tutorials. I make use of screenshots, code samples and even videos in several articles. However, there are pros and cons of each type of media you use. Screenshots are straightforward, you can also combine it with highlighting tools but somehow lacks interaction. Videos, on the other hand, give you interactivity but it can be difficult to navigate and review a certain step. So, I tried a new way of doing things.

Yesterday, I tried to do some experiment and wrote a tutorial about a [simple threading in .NET][5] but instead of posting just screenshots or just the videos, I made a screencast how I made it step-by-step using a [GIF Recorder][6] from [gifrecorder.com][7].

The post was able to get more than a hundred shares in just one day. I also asked some of my friends if what they think about that kind of tutorial and they have positive feedback about it and say it is way better than only having static and boring screenshots.

What I like about GIF Recorder is that it is very lightweight and works with my Windows 8. The interface is very simple and you don't even need any manual to use it! Aside from that, there is no time-limit for the trial version so you can use it as much as you want for free.

Andâ€¦. wait, there's more! Aside from the GIF recorder, they also include an [Animated GIF Editor][9]Â that you can use to modify your recorded GIF files. That's not it. You also have the ability to save the GIF to AVI format if you need it to upload as a video.

From now on, expect that tutorials will be interactive because of animated GIFs made by GIF Recorder. ![:\)][3]
