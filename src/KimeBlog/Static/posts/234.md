# the kimerran logs - Adobo Connection â€“ Mamaâ€™s Sweet Chicken Adobo

published: Nov 28, 2012

![][1]![][2]

There's a new taste along Boni, Mandaluyong and it's cooking Adobo. A definitely Filipino taste, Adobo Connection has opened another branch along the vicinity of Cybergate in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila.Â There are a lot of customers during the opening week. A lot must been looking for a new taste for their dinner. We personally tried it too for dinner to see if the Filipino favorite really connects with our stomach.

Adobo, Adobo and lots of Adobo. Guess what their main dish is? You can have your Adobo in classic, sweet, 'sa gata' or fried. You can have it with chicken or a mix of chicken and pork.

### What is Adobo Connection?

Adobo Connection was established by two Harvard Business School graduates. Their first store was opened last November 2010 in Makati, Philippines. It was backed by the same team that won the Best Foreign Franchise in the 2009 Entrepreneur Franchising Awards. (http://www.adoboconnection.com)

Their Kanin-All-U-Can (with unlimited servings of rice) menu is a choice between what kind of meat you want to be mixed with your Adobo. The common Filipino Adobo can either be done with chicken or pork or a mix of both. In Adobo Connection, they made the same selection categorized with the flavor or the way it is cooked â€“ fried, cooked in gata (coconut milk), sweet Adobo or classic.

I personally tried their Mama's Sweet Chicken Adobo and it was really delicious. The mix of sweet, sour and a bit spicy gives a new taste to the original Filipino Adobo.
