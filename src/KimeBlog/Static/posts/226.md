# the kimerran logs - Ice Bergsâ€™ Chicken Cordon And More

published: Oct 28, 2012

Just had simple date last October 28 to celebrate our monthsary. We watched a movie at SM Mall of Asia Cinema and after that, we had our dinner at Icebergs.

It's our first time there and I thought that they only serve desserts because of its name. Their branch at MOA is located at the seaside. Icebergs has been in the business since 1986.

We ordered a Salisbury steak (178 pesos) and a Chicken Cordon Â meal (198 pesos) for Trisha. We also hadÂ a serving of Kahlua Chocolate Sundae for dessert. The steak is just the common burger steak and nothing really fancy. But their Chicken Cordon is really delicious and has a bigger serving than my steak.

## Icebergs Menu and Specialties

Icebergs is known for its delicious desserts. They have a wide selection of banana splits, parfaits and sundaes and con-hielos (ice-mixed treats). They also serve rice meals such as salisbury steak and chicken cordon.

If you are going to dine at Icebergs, the price range of their food is from 100-300. A single serving will cost you about 200 pesos but bring extra money because you will definitely crave for their desserts. Next time we will try their Banana Split since we saw one and it really looks yummy. But still their Kahlua Chocolate Sundae is also a must-try

Icebergs has branches all over the metro, at SM Malls they have branches at SM Mall of Asia, SM Fairview, SM City North and as well as Robinsons Mall at Galleria and Robinsons Manila.
