i thought that was going to be the last that they are going to give our salary late. and not only late but they only gave us flat amount. they didn't even say "thanks to your OT's". but hey, it striked two!

i was suppose to have my pay today since tomorrow is a holiday and they said that when the payday is either a saturday, sunday or a holiday, they will give it earlier.

so here i am, moneyless, i have (counting) nineteen pesos remaining in my coin purse. im hungry, stressed, and confused.

im thinking that if there is going to be the third time, might as well consider looking for a more satisfying job.

of course, i love it, i was thinking that it's going to be my career already but if im going to die early because of it, then it may be the wrong decision to pursue it.

its not because that i really need the money, i do, to provide me my transportation expense and food. but what really concerns me is the needs of my family.

hope there's no more strike three.

hope they realize that they should also address our needs.
