# the kimerran logs - New Month, New Projects

published: Mar 11, 2013

New month means new project(s) for me at work. New techniques and tools to use for them. New opportunity for learning.

On the other side of the news, Adsense earnings is growing slowly but at least it is growing. I need to cleanup some post in Money Gizmo and optimize those that are not getting any SE traffic. Bought another domain (mutualfundinvestment.info) and will try to apply the same SEO techniques that I've learned.

I've got a new favorite forum â€“ warriorforum.com. Almost all that you need to learn about internet marketing and SEO stuff are there.

I have also moved Money Gizmo from HostASP.net to Blue Host. But I guess the domain registration will remain for a while (or not if I can transfer it to Blue Host as well).

So much learning, so much expenses. But all worth it!
