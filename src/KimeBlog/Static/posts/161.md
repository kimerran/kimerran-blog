# the kimerran logs - How To Order A Yellow Cab Pizza Online

published: Jun 13, 2012

It's my twin brothers and sister's birthday celebration, as well as fathers day celebration and it's my first time to order pizza online and I decided that it would be Yellow Cab.

### How to order Yellow Cab Pizza online?

1\. Visit their website at www.yellowcabpizza.com
2\. Click on the ORDER ONLINE button on the left side
3\. Create an account or sign-in
4\. Now, the fun part, select your pizza and then click on 'add to order'
5\. Check your cart to confirm. Repeat step 4 for every pizza that you want to order
6\. If you are done, click 'Im done' found on your cart
7\. Just click on next to proceed to payment.
8\. Wait for a call from Yellow Cab to confirm your order.
9\. Wait for the delivery guy for 30 to 40 minutes.
10\. Pay and enjoy your pizza.

I ordered 18 inches New York's finest because it's my favorite and it's one of their best sellers. I ordered at around 11 AM and the pizza arrived at 11:40 AM just right for lunch. I made my payment through credit card. I thought that I am going to pay it online but the delivery guy carries his own POS terminal where you swipe the credit card for payment. How convenient, right? Just writing this makes me hungry. Enjoy the photos! ![:\)][1]
