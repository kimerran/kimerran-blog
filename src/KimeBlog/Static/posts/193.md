# the kimerran logs - Daddy Daveâ€™s McKinley Hill, Taguig

published: Jul 24, 2012

A lot of food stores opened at McKinley Hill, Taguig including Rice In A Box, Pao Pao Xiao Chi, Sinangag Express and Greek Shawarma.Â We tried, Daddy Dave's today.

You can have a meal from 50-100 pesos. They have grilled food and as well as some vegetable viands. We tried Liempo, Pork BBQ and Tapsilog. The taste is so-so but I guess what you pay is what you get.
