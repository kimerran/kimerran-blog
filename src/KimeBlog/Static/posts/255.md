# What Plugins to Install on your WordPress Blog?

One reason why WordPress has been very popular is because of the its capability add more feature and functions through plugins. Plugins are small programs or code snippets that adds more features to your WordPress website. It can be used to add additional functionality, enhance speed or security, add customization and improve site search engine optimization among others.

There are thousands of plugins available through [WordPress.org][1]Â or from 3rd-parties who develop WordPress plugins for sale or even for free just like themes. You can install a plugin either by accessing the Plugins menu from your site's dashboard. Using this option, you can search for the plugin you need or upload a downloaded plugin zip file from WordPress.org or from third-party providers. Alternatively, you can also copy the contents of a plugin zip file to the location wp-content/plugins.

Since there are thousands of plugins available, there is a challenge in selecting the better one since there are a lot of similar plugins. Also, there are some plugins which contains malicious code and can open a security risk to your site. On this post I will share WordPress plugins I use in my WordPress sites to enhance performance, better search engine optimization and a robust security to avoid being hacked or spammed.

### Here are some of the WordPress plugins I use in my sites (in alphabetical order)

1\. Akismet. Akismet is a spam-buster plugin that comes with any WordPress installation. You will only need an Akismet key to start using this plugin. Akismet is also free but badly needs your donations so he can still continue making music.

2\. Better WP Security. Being very popular (especially in the internet) brings one more challenge into the picture â€“ hackers. Some people would either do it either for money of just for fun. So, to keep your WordPress site secure, install a security plugin just like this one.

3\. BWP Google XML Sitemaps. Sitemaps are important in search engine optimization. A sitemap is an XML file containing information about the content of your site, how often it is updated and the links to each one post or page. You can either create this one manually and update it every time you create a new post or page or you can use a plugin that can do that for you automatically.

4\. Contact Form Plugin. A contact form is important for your users to be able to keep in touch with you. With using this contact form plugin, I was able to be reached by my blog's readers and was able to create partnership with them.

5\. Disable Directory Listings.Â Being an open-source software, the directory structure of WordPress is quite known to the public. So, for added security, the default wp- folders should not be able to list down directory contents. Once this plugin is activated, it will only show blank pages once you visited restricted directories.

6\. Disqus Comment System. Among the different comment system that is supported in WordPress, I have chosen Disqus because of its uniqueness and its clean layout for my blog. Comment systems also provides protection from spamming â€“ one of the challenges I encountered with the default WordPress comments.

7\. Fancier Author Box. Simple yet it fit my needs. If you are using Google+ Authorship, then you should disable the default author feature in WordPress by disabling it in your theme options or removing the code in the theme editor and replace it with this plugin. It automatically adds the rel=author attribute to your G+ profile link. Since it is done per author, each blog post or article will have a correct attribution.

8\. Quick Adsense. If you are monetizing your blog by using Adsense or any online advertising network, then this plugin provides a quick way for you to add ad codes to strategic locations on a blog post or page.

9\. Regenerate Thumbnails. Sometimes when you change a theme, the thumbnails from the previous one will not fit another theme. Using this plugin, it will re-generate each thumbnail of every picture you have on your WordPress instance.

10\. Stop Spammer Registrations. While Akismet does a good job in eliminating comment spamming, it doesn't filter out registrations to your site. Luckily we have this plugin to kick-out any known spammer or hacker.

11\. Strictly Auto Tags. One challenge I had while I am still a blogger is to think and insert tags. Tags are also used for SEO and most of the time, the keyword/s that you are targeting for your website or blog. This plugin will automatically include the most relevant tags once you publish your posts.

12\. W3 Total Cache. Performance is also important as part of user experience. No one will like to stay longer in slow website. What it does is it saves the most commonly accessed pages in its cache making it more faster to be accessed by site visitors.

13\. WordPress SEO. Yoast has done a pretty good job to enable non-SEO experts to enable search engine optimization on their blog. You just have to focus more on your content because over-stuffing keywords on your blog can bring negative results to your search engine rankings.

14\. WP-reCAPTCHA. Another anti-spam plugin, this is also used to prevent spam registrations if you have enabled users to register on your blog. You need to register to obtain your private and public keys. Just enter those public and private keys to start using this plugin.

15\. WP Socializer. If you want to be indexed and get high rankings in the search engine results page, you might want to tap the power of social media and one plugin you can use to enable social-media buttons is WP Socializer.



WordPress plugins can put your blog or site from zero to nothing. You can have a secured, fast and search engine optimized blog once you have setup the correct combinations of plugins. What's your favorite WordPress plugin? Let us know by posting in the comment section below.
