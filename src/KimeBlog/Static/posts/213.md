# the kimerran logs - Classic Savory SM Megamall

published: Aug 15, 2012

So, we went last Saturday to SM Megamall to watch 'The Healing' â€“ a horror movie starred by Vilma Santos and Kim Chiu. But before the movie, we had our early dinner at Classic Savory. Thanks to Tita Chon for the treat!

We had Savory Chicken for the main course, with Yang Chow rice and Pansit Miki Bihon. The chicken costs 195 pesos for half, while the whole costs 345 pesos. We also orderedÂ Yangchow rice which costs 175 pesos and Pansit Miki Bihon for 195 pesos per plate.

We also had tropical coolers which is basically a 'four seasons' drink for 45 pesos.

### Classic Savory History

I think one of the pioneers in fast-food is Classic Savory having the foundation just after the World War II. It was founded by the Ting brothers who put up a 'panciteria' in the district of Quaipo serving mainly lomi.

From a small panciteria to a very popular chicken house, Classic Savory opened its first branch in Escolta. Now serving both Filipino and Chinese dishes for more than 50 years, they now also offers delivery services for bulk orders, catering and functions.

### Locations of Classic Savory

There are about more than 60 branches of Classic Savory in the Philippines, 30 in Metro Manila, 2 in Rizal, 12 in Northern Luzon, 10 in Southern Luzon, 3 in Visayas Region and 5 in Mindanao.
