Woke up at 9:55am. Fixed myself. It's TRISHA's birthday! 

Rode bus until heritage. Then jeep. We met at magallanes flyover (i think that's the name of that place). Gave my pretty simple gifts to her. A scrapbook and a greeting card. 
Rode jeep then walk to don bosco church. We attended mass. We ate at northpark with her mom and dad. That was a delicious lunch! XD

Then after lunch, went to glorietta to kill some time. And at around past 3pm, we are on our way to star city. 
There we went to winter funland and have to pay for pictures. mr. photographer offered 5 shots for 100. 
At least we dont have to pay 100 per shot. that was really cool (literally). 

But not as big as i am expecting. we stroll around the park. took some (a lot really) pictures. And I tell you, this is one of the best days ever for me. 
After some tiring picture takings and strolling, we went to red ribbon to eat dinner (her treat!~oh yeah!) XD that chicken is chicken! 
And plus tiramisu cake! yummy indeed! Trisha if you are reading this – I LOVE YOU! Happy birthday again!
