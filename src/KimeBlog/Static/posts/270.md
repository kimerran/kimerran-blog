# 'Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 required' Error on Windows Phone Game (XNA)

[Â Home][1]Â >Â [Windows Phone][2]Â >Â 'Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 required' Error on Windows Phone Game (XNA)

I am currently studying Windows Phone XNA projects and I created one using Visual Studio 2012. So, I was able to open the template but unfortunately when I push F5 for debug, Visual Studio 2012 gave me this error message.

'Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 required'

What seems to cause the problem?

After encountering this issue, I did a quick Google search and found out that there is a bug in XNA Game Studio 4.0 and also that development using Visual Basic is currently not supported (or at least not stable).

To try to fix this error, I have downloaded and installed[ Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0 Refresh][5] update.

Did it solved the problem?

NO. Unfortunately the fix is only applicable to Visual Studio 2010. Since I am using Visual Studio 2012, the refresh update doesn't apply. It was also known that if you want to create XNA apps using VB.NET, you have to [link the assemblies on your own][7] (which I am lazy to do).

So, I guess I need to study XNA using C# for the mean time.
