# the kimerran logs - Bye, Long Hair. Bye, Twilight Saga.

published: Nov 19, 2012

Trisha and I went to see the last part of the Twilight Saga last Saturday. It's still a good movie to watch though we thought that the part 1 and 2 can be just a single movie. Anyway, I wanted to call it 'Breaking Apart' because on the battle scene, everyone is breaking apart each one â€“ literally.

Anyway, here's my favorite scene from the movie.

Finished Saturday with a dinner from [World Chicken][3] â€“ another Trisha's favorite.

It's also been months since I had my hair trimmed. I told myself that I won't get it cut until my project at work got deployed. But unfortunately, it is getting longer and not neat to look at (and I don't want to look unprofessional at work). Well at least I want to look neat and clean plus I get irritated when hair blocks my eyes.

So, went to [GQ Barber Shop][4] at SM Sucat today with Trisha. It was actually my second time there. Their service is good and fast that's why they have a lot of customers during my first time.

After that, we went to Vibes Massage Service at SM Sucat. Their masseurs are all blind. It was our first time there and probably will come back for more. They've got good masseurs and their services are affordable. Guess I'm ready for the week of stress again.
