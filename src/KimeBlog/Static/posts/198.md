# the kimerran logs - Chowking Orange Chicken Lauriat

published: Jul 26, 2012

So Trisha had to find a new pair of glass since she lost it. We have checked several optical shops during the day but unfortunately we cannot find a ready-made one because that's for far-sighted people only, she's a near-sighted.

Before that, we had lunch at Chowking Pasong Tamo. She ordered an Orange Chicken Lauriat while I had my favorite Chao Fan.

You can have this for 135 pesos only same with Sweet and Sour Pork, Lumpiang Shanghai, Breaded Fish and Chicken Supreme Lauriats. While the Chinese-style fried chicken is for 159 pesos.

A lauriat comes with Yangchow rice, Pansit, Buchi and Chicharap. It comes with a free softdrinks too.

For the Chao Fan, Pork and Chorizo costs 49 pesos. Beef for 69 pesos. Â Yangchow and Spicy chao fan for 89 pesos. If you will add 3-pieces siomai, you ned to add 30 pesos.
