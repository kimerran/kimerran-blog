# the kimerran logs - Chicken Bon Chon

published: Jul 15, 2012

Personally I think the new Spiderman movie was not as good as the last 3 by Toby Maguire. Might be because it focuses more on spidey's past rather than the villains as portrayed by the last 3 movies. But all in all, it is still a great movie to watch.

We had [Kettle Korn][1] BBQ (50 pesos for the large one) and [Gong Cha milk tea][2] while we watched [The Amazing Spiderman][3]. The movie started around 5:00 PM and finished at around 7:30 PM â€“ exact time for dinner.

We decided to try out Bon Chon â€“ one of the new chicken restaurant in the Philippines. It is a South Korean based and these days one of the restaurants where you will find it difficult to find a vacant chair.

We ordered two boxed meals for 145 pesos each and chosen option B which is the breast fillet. This comes with drinks already and you may choose if you want Soy Garlic or Spicy flavor.

Option A is the wings part. Option B is the breast fillet. Option C is drumstick. You can also have non-chicken boxed meals such as crispy fish, crispy squid, fish and chips, and bulgogi meals such as beef bulgogi, crunchy chicken bulgogi or bulgogi wrapbox.

If you don't want a complete meal, you can also order Big Box in which you can choose either the wings, breast or drumstick chicken part. Small box will cost 185 peso, medium for 365 pesos and the large one for 720 pesos.

If you want 50 pieces of Bon Chon Chicken Wings, you can have it for 1395 pesos or for the same amount you can already have 32 chops or the breast fillet part.

They also serve other main dishes such as Chapchae, fish taco, calamari and the bulgogi meals. Price range is from 75 to 125 pesos.

Side dishes are also available such as fries, kimchi coleslaw, tofu salad and caesar salad which you can have additional chicken as well. Price range is from 45 to 125 pesos.

Drinks available are iced tea, softdrinks, beer, stella artois and hoegaarden which will costs you 28 to 45 pesos. Stella artois will cost you 125 pesos while the Hoegaarden costs 150 pesos.

If you want some sweets for dessert, you may want to try KoYo or Korean Yogurt for 75 pesos only.

There's no question while there are a lot of people dining on this chicken restaurant. Will definitely comeback to try out other dishes. Hope to see more branches around the metro.
