Yesterday is a PC-cleanup day and so I did my usual routine of firing up CCleaner and Defraggler to boost my laptop's performance. Aside from that I need to keep files from my Downloads and Temp directories organized so I created a simple console application that could do this for me faster.

## Zinop

Introducing [zinop][1] - a 'messy files organizer' tool that sorts all files in a directory according to their file extension. Just drag a directory to the executable (zinop.exe) and ta-da! you're files are now organized! Check out the demo below or [source code at github][5]

## Webgeek.ph now running on Discourse

![WebGeek on Discourse](http://blog.kimerran.com/static/img/webgeek-discourse.GIF)

I've been a reader and follower of [Webgeek Philippines][3] since last year and been also a member of their forums. And now they are running [Discourse][] - a quite new forum/comment system built by the guys who made StackOverflow. The site is still on beta so membership is still on 'invite-only' mode.


## Blog updates
Been able to extract my blog posts from my old blog and GizmoBlogr but still needs some cleanup. Done with the [projects][4] page where you can view most of what I am currently working at.
