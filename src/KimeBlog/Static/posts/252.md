# the kimerran logs - Wishing for a great week ahead!

published: Mar 18, 2013

Some clicks cost 1 cent while some are $1 while some are $10 while some are even $10 or $10. On every 100 views, there's 1 click â€“ 1% CTR. Not bad either. And I'm getting paid around 10 cents for each. Not very bad. I am talking about Adsense.

Still learning about SEO and Adsense. This is really a challenging game. So I soft-launched [MFI][1]. An SEO experiment.

[Sisig Bytes][2] is still on its early stage and planning to at least edit one article per day or at least 5 posts per week.

Here are my to-do to make progress (let's hope I can pay my Internet connection so I can do faster):

* Edit at least one post per day at SISIG BYTES
* Publish at least one post per day at MONEY GIZMO
* Create content at MFI at least 3x a week

Planning to buy Klasmeyt.com and Likja.com by next week if I can get some money or probably by the end of the month.
