It is somewhat like a headless virtual machine manager recommended for software development or if you are just trying some new things out. Here's how I got it up and running in my Windows machine.

1\. [Download and install Vagrant][3].

2\. Download a box. You can download OS images (they call it boxes) from [Vagrantbox.es][4]. I prefer downloading the files manually and adding them using the method below.
```
vagrant box add "NAME_OF_YOUR_BOX" "FILENAME.box"
```
3\. Create a folder and run _vagrant init_.
```
vagrant init
```
4\. Open vagrantfile and look for _config.vm.box_. Set this to the name of your box back in step 2.
```
 config.vm.box = "NAME_OF_YOUR_BOX"
```
5\. To start running the box. Enter _vagrant up_. It will also automatically _SSH_ to your box and give you terminal prompt
```
vagrant up
```


### Now, let's do some test development!

I will install Ruby on Rails to test this Vagrant box. I did run the following script on the terminal.

### Why choose Vagrant boxes?
- __Develop on your host machine!__ by default your folder will be mounted as _/vagrant_ on the guest machine (your box) so I did the code editing on Windows using my favorite editor and it automagically syncs with my code on the box!

- __Smaller memory footprint__ (save RAM!) look at this memory consumption.

- __Automate installation__ using [postinstall.sh][5]
