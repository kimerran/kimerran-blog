# the kimerran logs - Hong Kong Style Noodles (The Original)

published: Jul 7, 2012

Just went to St. Claire's Medical Center to have a urinalysis. For me to be sure that my pre-employment medical exam at Clinica Manila will be cleared.Â After that, we went to Walmart to have merienda before we go at my girlfriend's house. We decided to eat friend noodles â€“ Hong Kong Style Noodles (The Original). We had a Dimsum Noodle. Look, the budget is very tight during these days. :pÂ After these noodles, Trisha also bought Â French Fries. Forgot to take pictures though. ![:\(][1]
