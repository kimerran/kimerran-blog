# Your Developer Is A Rock Star!

Warning: This post might sound bitter or offensive. But for those who do manage software developers like me, it's time to let you know that we, the ever-brave programmers who uses all our senses (including the third eye) to convert ideas to money-making piece of software or apps as we call it today, that we should be the ROCK STAR of the organization.

I won't give any reasons why. Here's a hint: what drives business today?

So, without further ado, here's how you let the geeky-squad feel that they're the rock star of the organization.

1. Give them a place to work in. A space. With a LAN connection they can use to access the internet and everything they need to access such as file servers, database servers, web servers, etc. This is to achieve what Psychologists calls as 'The Flow'. You can read an article about this one â€“ [The Flow â€” Programming in Ecstasy by Psygrammer.com][3].
2. Give them the best MACHINE! Fast CPU, lot's of RAM, fast and 'working' hard drives. Optional: A good keyboard and mouse.
3. Â A BIG screen (preferably 24 to 32 inches). We love big monitors. It kills our productivity when we have to switch from window to window while we write some code.
4. Good chair. Period.
5. Development tools. Not your plain old notepad.

I know this is not the complete list, well at least I've given you the basic idea. If you want to maximize the productivity of your developer, don't give them ALL types of task at once. From design, to writing codes, to testing, to debugging, to deployment up to support. If you do, then expect that quality is sacrificed.

PS. We also want ADMIN rights on our PC too. ![:P][1]
