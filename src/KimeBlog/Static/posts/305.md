You might be working on a project that only requires a file-based database and want to utilize Entity Framework as ORM. I do, and I encounter this problem while trying Brice's example from [here][1].

Are you having trouble making __Entity Framework__ work with your SQLite database? Here's a short and simple tutorial on how to use Entity Framework 6 with a SQLite database.

1\. Open Package Manager Console (Tools > Library Package Manager > Package Manager Console) from Visual Studio and add Entity Framework to your project

![1-install entity framework][4]


2\. Install __SQLite__ and __Linq2DB__ as well

![2-install sqlite][5]

![3-install linq2db sqlite][6]

3\. Open your __App.Config / Web.Config__ and add the following line inside the  section


After adding the provider, your application should now run properly.
