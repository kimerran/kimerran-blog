You might be working on a project that only requires a file-based database and want to utilize Entity Framework as ORM. I do, and I encounter this problem while trying Brice's example from [here][1].

Are you having trouble making Entity Framework work with your SQLite database? Here's a short and simple tutorial on how to use Entity Framework 6 with a SQLite database.

1\. Open Package Manager Console (Tools > Library Package Manager > Package Manager Console) from Visual Studio and add Entity Framework to your project

![1-install entity framework][2]![1-install entity framework][4]

Â 

2\. Install SQLite and Linq2DB as well

![2-install sqlite][2]![2-install sqlite][5]

Â 

![3-install linq2db sqlite][2]![3-install linq2db sqlite][6]

Â 

3\. Open your App.Config / Web.Config and add the following line inside the  section





After adding the provider, your application should now run properly.
