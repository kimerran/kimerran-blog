# the kimerran logs - Happy Lemon SM Megamall

published: Aug 15, 2012

One of the current hype in the world of food and drinks is Milk Tea. So far we have tried Gong Cha and Serenitea and as well as Chatime. So far, we love the taste of milk teas from Gong Cha and ChatimeÂ Today, we tried something new â€“ Happy Lemon.

Since this is only a try, we ordered one milk tea with pudding. Tasted like that of Serenitea where you can really taste the 'tea' in it, we still love the relaxing taste of Happy Lemon's milk tea. Though, it's priced a bit higher than most milk tea in the competition, it is still worth the try.

Â 

### Some Happy Lemon fun-facts

Did you know that Happy Lemon in the Philippines is partly-owned by Smart Gilas/TV host Chris Tiu together with his friends?

Did you know that Happy Lemon's first branch in the Philippines is located in Promenade Greenhills?

Did you know that tea parties were practiced by the Chinese communities since British rule over Hongkong?

Did you know that in Malaysia and Singapore, there was Teh See which is sold in coffee shops and is made from tea and evaporated milk?
