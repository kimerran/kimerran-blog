# the kimerran logs - 2nd Week of September 2012

published: Sep 16, 2012

It's my first 5K run and even the sun didn't smiled upon us, we still passed the finish line. Trisha even got 7th place in the students category.Â

My weekend was tiresome and very active indeed. Time to get back to work mode for tomorrow. Guess we need to indulge a bit right? Had our lunch at [Sizzling Plate][4] and [Tropical Hut][5] at MOA before we bought supplies for the week.

I want to start studying Â more advanced .NET programming this week or even check out VS 2012 for Metro style apps. ![:\)][1]
