# the kimerran logs - Carlâ€™s Jr. At Midvalley Megamall

published: Aug 4, 2013

To give myself a treat since it was my 25th birthday, I went to Mid Valley Megamall and planned to watch Wolverine. But since there's a long line and thinking that watching alone is not that fun, I postponed watching the movie there and I just decided to go window shopping and eat lunch.

Carl's Jr. is an American fast-food chain with branches in almost every side of the world including Malaysia.

I ordered The Big Carl which is about 4 inches in diameter with double patty and bigger than McDonald's quarter pounder. My order comes with medium fries (which I consider 'large' for me) and medium drinks. This was actually priced RM 12.90 for sandwich and RM 17.40 for combo meal but my receipt has a total of RM 18.90 plus RM 1.13 government tax so I paid RM 20.05.

Price ranges from RM 9 -RM 20 for the sandwiches and from RM 13 to RM 23 for the combo which I think comes with fries and drinks. If you want to have a heavy lunch or dinner, then I suggest try one of their burgers!
