As of today, June 19, 2012, there's only 10 branches of Gong Cha in the Philippines. The 10th branch is located at Marquee Mall in Pampanga and is the first Gong Cha branch outside Metro Manila.

I can say that Gong Cha is our favorite Milk Tea so far though we have only tried their Winter Melon Milk Tea. We love the right sweetness blend of milk, tea and cream. I will try to taste all their flavors as long as budget allows. ![:P][1]![:P][4]
