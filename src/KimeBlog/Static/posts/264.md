# the kimerran logs - St. Johnâ€™s Cathedral at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

published: Aug 20, 2013

If you are in Malaysia as a tourist or an Overseas Filipino Worker and looking for a Catholic Church, then you should check out St. John's Cathedral in Kuala Lumpur.

St. John's Cathedral is one of the many catholic churches in Malaysia. And do you know that during the time it was established (in 1883), it is the only catholic church in Selangor?

During my first week in Malaysia, this is where I had my first mass. And some friends told me to go here since there are a lot of Filipinos who attend mass here. And if you are also craving for Pinoy food, you can check out our Kababayan selling outside. Though prices are a bit higher than your 'mamak' food, it's all worth it especially if you are missing the taste of Adobo, Kare-Kare, Bopis, or Dinuguan.

### So, how does one get there?

From the ever famous KL Sentral, just take an LRT (Kelana Jaya Lane) to Masjid Jamek. And from there, it's walking distance. Just follow this direction and you'll get there in no time. Travel time is around 10-20 minutes from KL Sentral.
