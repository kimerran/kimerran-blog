# the kimerran logs - Ideas Overflow

published: Mar 16, 2013

Saturday and still cannot sleep. Have a lot of IDEAS. Including some weird ones like 'a site where you can post something BAD about someone beside you' like

> the GUY beside me SMELLS like FISH (put location coordinates here).

Andâ€¦ that guy can check out things on the same location as where as he is present.

Anyway, just trashed that idea because you can already do that on Twitter. Just weird. Weird.

Â 

Serious things.

OK. So I was able to KT today about LINQ2SQL and Decompiling and other good stuff. I was now on my way to creating my very first ASP.NET project which will also be my first MVC project which will also be my first project using LINQ2SQL. So much for FIRST-times.

During the week I was able to do so many many many things for Money Gizmo. [I moved it from my junky HOSTASP host to Blue Host ][1]last week and as part of that I also went through [transferring of the domain name][2] itself. Just went through e-mail exchanges between me and BH support and between me and HOSTASP support. Oh well, just the last step â€“ wait for Monday without replying to the confirmation.

I was also able to install two great stuff to MG â€“ [Ask @ Money Gizmo][3] using Question2Answer and LINK Forwarder (/go) using YOURLS â€“ the same thing I used for COMXPH/l/ links. I also woke up with a lot of shares from my latest blog post about [employees spending their salaries during pay day][4]. Guess why? A RT and FB Share from Sun Life Philippines. Guess it's the third time.

Talking about IDEAS. Adamsonian.PH is near its death. Not sure what I'm going to do with my vBulletin license. But I've thought of something that can use TAN fanbase â€“ [a Q&A for them][5]. I think it's better than forum because it's easier to use and very straightforward.

Also thinking of creating a modern Q&A ASP.NET MVC -[ Noob Exchange][6]. Feasible? I guess if I can only think of things that's not yet present in the STACK sites.

PS.

I also did an LINK WHEELR application you can use to randomize link wheel building. Soon to use!

### Share and Enjoy
