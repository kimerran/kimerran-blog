# the kimerran logs - Certifications? Not Yet.

published: Mar 5, 2014

> YOU'LL GO FARTHER WITH DEPTH THAN WITH BREADTH.

During the last few days I was thinking if I am going to pursue certifications. And my decision is 'not yet'. Good thing I [posted][1] this on Microsoft Developers â€“ Philippines Facebook group and received expert advices.

Where Am I Coming From?

As a developer (a serious one), I wanted career growth as fast as possible. I had a year of 'professional' experience with Visual Basic .NET, a year of 'professional' experience with Windows Presentation Foundation, and half-year 'professional' experience currently with ASP.NET Webforms.

Am I going too fast? They said so.

So, how?

There's a book titled [The Clean Coder][2] by Robert Martin where he mentioned that if you are working 40 hours a week, then you should allocate around 20 hours studying to enhance yours skills. And that's what I'm going to do (in a minimized and a-bit-different way).

> All Work And No Play Makes Jack A Dull Boy

Aside from maintaining some blogs (for extra income), I wanted to finish at least one book per month. [Some][3] would say that technical books are not meant Â to be read in one sitting that titles such as 'Learn ____ in ___ Days' seems not that realistic.

Combining Mastery with Reading, I aim to finish a book titled 'Pro ASP.NET 4 in C#' in the next couple of months.

What about Play?

How about going to the gym, watching TV Series (Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, etc), playing badminton, bowling, tennis? How about playing Clash of Clans? How about watching movies and playing the guitar?

Time Management! Starting this week I will do a fortnightly cycle of WORK and PLAY. Enter my Calendar.

![My Work-Play Calendar][4]![My Work-Play Calendar][5]

For weeks tagged as STUDY, I will read books in the morning and at night, I would write and maintain blogs and as well as watch 'training' videos.

For weeks tagged as PLAY, No work should be done.
