Some of today's popular web frameworks arranged by programming languages you can use them with. Note that this is not a complete list.

###C&#35;
__[ASP.NET MVC][1]__. 
Also excited about [ASP.NET vNext][2]. Worth looking at : [Nancy][3]

###Ruby. 
[Ruby on Rails][4] - the most popular web framework for Ruby. 
Might take a look at [Sinatra][10].

###Python. 
Later this year I will study and learn about Python and of course built something with it. Any [WSGI][5]-compatible frameworks will do but will try [Django][6] first or [TurboGears][7]

###Java. 
I'm javaphobic. But if ever I decided to learn one, I will checkout Scala programming language which runs on JVM and maybe fiddle with [Play][8] or [Lift][9] or Scalatra.

###JavaScript. 
The hype today - node.js!

###PHP. Wait, what? No PHP?
No plans on learning any PHP framework for now.

###That's a lot!
Yes, no. Learning programming should be exponential. The more you mature as a programmer, the faster you learn.
