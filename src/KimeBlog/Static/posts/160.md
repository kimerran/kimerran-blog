# the kimerran logs - Minute Maid Pulpy Mango Orange

published: Jun 12, 2012

One of the juices I always drink. A healthy drink because it has real fruit pulp and the flavor really tastes like orange and mango. Just the right blend. I always buy this one from the 7-11 store when I am at the office and really refreshes me especially during the stressful days.

On the side note:

I happen to read the some sort of disclaimer written on the bottle's label. It says 'May contain sediments and occasional light or dark specks, which are inherent to fruits. Shake well before drinking'. There you have it, please shake the bottle before choking, I mean drinking.
