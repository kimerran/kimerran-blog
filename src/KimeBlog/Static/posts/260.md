# Choosing Your WordPress Theme | GizmoBlogr

After a successful installation of WordPress either you have a hosted or self-hosted WordPress blog, the look of your site will be the default WordPress theme either the Twenty Twelve or Twenty Eleven as of this writing. As a blogger, you may want to use the default theme style but I strongly suggest that you choose a theme that fits the content of your blog.

Your theme should be relevant to the content of your blog but always remember that it should also stay as useful as possible to the users. Don't make black background when your font is dark. The rule is, if you are not comfortable enough in reading your blog post, then don't use that theme.

Personally, I just look for themes which are both responsive and simple. I don't go with themes with many images and unnecessary decorations as these could make the size of the web page bigger. You should also consider the performance of the theme. If a theme makes a page to load slower, don't use it. Remember that your readers won't wait for a page to load 10 seconds before they can see the blog post.

So, where do you get a WordPress theme?

If you want free and tried-and-tested WordPress themes, I strongly recommend the [official WordPress themes site][1]. From there you can select from over a thousand of both free and paid themes. If you are just starting your blog, just select from any of the free themes. There are a lot of of great free themes of which [Max Magazine][2] is one of my favorites (maybe I am just a fan of News or Magazine-type themes.

But don't get me wrong, there are also premium WordPress themes out there. You can select from [My Theme Shop][3], Woo Themes, Theme Forest and many more! Aside from very nice design and customization offered by premium themes, most of them are licensed under GPL which means you can use the themes for as many sites as you can. With regards to some pricing schemes, I don't suggest buying membership licenses if you don't have a lot of sites or you don't change themes every now and then. It might cost you more rather than saving.

Still cannot choose what themes to use?

But if you don't like any of the themes from the official theme repository or any of all the premium theme providers, you can create your own WordPress themes. WordPress.org has a nice [guide][6]Â to get you started. If starting from scratch is not your thing, there are [theme frameworks][7] available that you can use to develop your own themes.

Hope I did helped you in choosing your very first WordPress theme. In summary you have these options: choosing from free or paid themes from the WordPress.org Themes, getting a trial or buying from premium themes provider or creating your own theme either from scratch or by using theme frameworks.



What about asking your favorite WordPress theme? Mine is [Glamour from My Theme Shop][3] â€“ the theme I used in this blog. What's yours?
