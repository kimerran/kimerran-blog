# the kimerran logs - Food For my First Week in Kuala Lumpur

published: Aug 27, 2013

During my first two weeks in Malaysia, I have a little goal for myself â€“ to taste the local foods. I am hesitant during my first day since I am afraid to get sick especially that I need to report at work in 2 days. So, I just had a bit of McDonalds and was treated by a friend in KFC.

But during my first week, I had my first taste of authentic Malaysian cuisine and since then I decided to TASTE 'EM ALL! Here are some of what I tasted during my first two weeks and majority of it are spicy food, so if you love spicy food, you will love it here!

### Chicken Rice

May sound plain 'ol chicken with a serving of rice but no! You can buy this almost anywhere here in Malaysia. It is one delicious meal and a must-try for foreigners.

### Indian Rojak

One day my officemate asked me to try this one. It's like a salad-mixed-with-bread with a sweet-spicy dip. You can also have 'squid' if you want but I prefer this 'vegetarian' style one.

### Teh Ais

If you need to cool down, then order a glass of 'Teh Ais' or iced tea (with milk).

### Nasi Lemak w/ Ayam Kari

You've never been to Malaysia if you haven't tried Nasi Lemak. You might not see the Nasi Lemak here in this picture (cause it's covered in Ayam Kari) but Nasi Lemak is a dish on its own. Nasi Lemak is rice with anchovies, roasted nuts and sauce. Ayam Kari well, translates to 'chicken curry'. Warning: It is Spicy.

When travelling to Malaysia, one thing to be part of your itinerary is to taste ALL local cuisine (I know I have a long way to go on this one). If you aren't aware, Malaysia is composed of three major race. Now, imagine your 'must-taste' list.
