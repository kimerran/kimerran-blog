just created this live journal account as kimerran
who is kimerran anyway? – if you can’t guess who then you may be an idiot

"the kaaba" – two words i typed so that live journal will know that im not a web bot

things i did during the last five hours:

+ get the laptop im using for my 3rd project at pfizer
+ greet my co-interns good morning via outlook
+ give cy pokemon games (hahaha)
+ read abnkkbsnpla ko? by bob ong (e-book version – done with the physical book)
+ ate lunch with cy and jhem
+ i did start LJing – dont ask how i found this site
