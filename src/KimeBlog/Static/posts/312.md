I was a student  once and I regret not learning these things while in college. As someone who loves software development, here are some things I would tell my younger self.

1\. __Learn source control__. As a developer, you code is gold. Whether using SVN, Git or Mercurial, you should learn this as early as possible.

2\. __Don't stick to VB6, C#, Java or PHP.__ I listed them here because most schools teach basic programming using these languages. As a challenge to my younger self, I will tell him to study other programming languages such as Perl, Ruby, Python, Go, Haskell, Scala, Clojure among others. It would be fun.

3\. __Publish to Github.__ You just don't say <i>'I code well'</i>. __You show it!__

4\. __Contribute to open source.__ As a user of open-source, I believe we have the responsibility to give back. Make that 'push' request back to the open source project repository!

5\. __Join a group.__ Pair programming will give you more output than doing it alone. Learn from other students as well, it's one of the fastest way to code.

6\. __Learn [full-stack][1].__ Don't just learn how to do the UI, or just the backend, or just how to manage networks or databases. Learn the stack all the way from the bottom to the top.

7\. __Use ORM.__ SQL is good, it works. But learning how to utilize [Object-Relational Mapper][2] will give you the edge among other developers.

8\. __Cross-platform.__ If you are into mobile development, you might want to publish to all platforms as much as possible. X-platform development is the way to go.

9\. __Learn how to hack.__ You will realize the value of knowledge in hacking when someone already hacked your system.

10\. __Buy a domain.__ Publish your work. A top-level domain only costs around 10-15 dollars per year. Publishing in the internet will teach you a lot of things. Believe me, I did.

11\. __Earn money.__ It's more fun if you could earn some money from what you do. If you really love what you do, money will follow for sure.

12\. __Learn how to learn.__ Most of us will stop learning new things after they graduate from school. Don't be like them. Learn more and more as you progress in you career. You don't need a LOT of money to learn. Be creative.


> __P.S.__: Don't forget to have fun. :p
