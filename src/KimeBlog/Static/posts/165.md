# the kimerran logs - McDonalds Cheese Burger and Fries

published: Jun 17, 2012

We often eat at McDo because it's something we can afford and we like the flavor of the food they serve. And just to share, my favorite at McDo is their Cheese Burger, Trisha's is their fries.

After we bought our [Milk Tea from Serenitea][4], we went to McDonalds at Resorts World Manila to buy our snacks. We just bought one cheese burger, one chicken burger and fries and had the milk teas for drinks. Just two hungry pigs, aren't we?
