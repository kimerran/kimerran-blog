after hours of work during a saturday. we went to padi's point at moa to celebrate jonel's birthday/breakday. at start it was a very stressful evening, cause i haven't ate diner and all food chains are closing. so we have to walk at the entrance of the mall just to eat diner.

beer is not my favorite drink. i can only slurp a glass or two.

then later after some drinks, we decided to bring it on the dance floor. the music is rock and pop. all i did was head bangs. so now, i have an aching neck and head. sigh.

just another sunday morning. transferred and re-organized lot of files from my disk to my backup HDD. wish i can buy a new one with 500gb of memory.

i told my self to sleep at 12. but its already 1am.

ps. i wished again to find her asap. i ain't really lucky finding the right one who can love me back =(
