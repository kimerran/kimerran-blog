# the kimerran logs - I Created Sisig Bytes

published: Feb 4, 2013

Today, I have setup [Sisig Bytes][1]. I bought this domain last week before I went to Aklan to attend Trisha's cousin's wedding. My plan about this site is to consolidate everything I blog about using WordPress Multi-site.

: SIZZLING How-To's, News and Reviews

Â 

I started yesterday around 9 PM after dinner. I setup WP Multi-site. Now, instead of having sub-domains, I did a sub-directory format WordPress site network. It's more SEO-friendly that what I did with COMX.PH.

I also transferred Spicy Kendi and Hack Chix to this site. These two sites will now be known as Sisig Bytes Food and Sisig Bytes Technology blogs respectively.

I am also done installing the basic plugins needed such as All In One SEO Pack, Disqus Comments, Network Latest Posts, Related Posts Thumbnails and WP Socializer.

## Here's my remaining to-do list:

1\. Optimize EACH post for SEO because I already learned the basics

2\. Put every post in their respective category â€“ HOW TO, NEWS or REVIEW

3\. Think of the remaining subject to blog about. I already have FOOD, TECH and TRAVEL. What should be the topic for color YELLOW? Perhaps LIFESTYLE? So I can blog about anything?

4\. Implement analytics code from of course my analytics.comx.ph

5\. Create a twitter account (@sisigbytes)

6\. Create a logo and cover photo for the Sisig Bytes page and have at least 25 likes before the launch

7\. Standardized footer area

8\. Create topblogs account. What category? Update: I created PERSONAL

Okay. Time to sleep because I have a training tomorrow at 9 AM. ![:\)][2]
