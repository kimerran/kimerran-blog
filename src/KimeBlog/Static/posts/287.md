# Visual Studio 2012 VS Visual Studio 2013 Start-Up and Build Speed

[Â Home][1]Â >Â [Featured][2]Â >Â Visual Studio 2012 VS Visual Studio 2013 Start-Up and Build Speed

![visual studio 2013 build speed][3]![visual studio 2013 build speed][4]Too many VS! Now, I want to check if there is a significant difference in solution building between Visual Studio 2012 and the recently released Visual Studio 2013. Also, I want to know if someone starts faster than the other.

For this test, I am using my more than one year old, low-end laptop, ASUS K43SD. Machine specs below:

* CPU: Intel Core i3 2350M Sandy Bridge Â @ 2.3GHz
* RAM: 6 GB DDR3
* HDD : 1 TB Western Digital SATA 3 @ 6 Gb/s
* Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 610M
* OS: Windows 8.1 Pro

On to the tests. On the following videos, I have downloaded [Orchard][5], cleaned and then re-built the whole solution.



Visual Studio 2012

Visual Studio 2013

So, you judge for yourself. Another thing to notice is that both builds projects in multiples of four. You know why? Yes, it is using [parallel tasks][6] and since my Core i3 has four logical processors, it builds four projects at a time. Sweet.

And here's a bonus. Want to see Visual Studio 2013 in action? Here's the most famous Hello World program written using Visual Studio 2013. Click to play the motion picture.
