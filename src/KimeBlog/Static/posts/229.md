# the kimerran logs - Hello November 2012

published: Nov 8, 2012

So, here I am still awake and had thought of updating my blog. Just finished two episodes of Shippuden from crunchyRoll.com while I also download videos-of-interest from the recent Build 2012. Just to share, you can stream/download all the sessions for free [here][1]. And just to share too, everyone who attended the Build physicall got a 100 gig storage of SkyDrive, one piece of the new Microsoft Surface (and that's a wow!) and the new Lumia 920 (that's another wow!). Asking myself when would be the time for the same opportunity?

Just celebrated our 0Ã—17 monthsary. As usual we had a simple celebration together, we went to eat at [Ice Berg at MoA][4] and watched One Secret Affair. Â Trisha loved the Ice Cream. It was so delicious I forgot it's name.

During the holidays, I went to 2-3 cemeteries. During the 1st of November we went to Manila South Cemetery and the cemetery at Pasig and on the 2nd to the Pasay City Public Cemetery where my grandfather and brother rests. Guess who painted it?

And later that day, I got a facebook message from Aubie and Des inviting me and Trisha for a movie. So we go and had dinner with them as well. Of course with Reman. Since there's no celebration for that day, we decided that it would be a post-birthday celebration for Miccah (though she's not physically present). Here's your Siomai ala Saging modeled by Des.

More, more and more events to come before the year end!
