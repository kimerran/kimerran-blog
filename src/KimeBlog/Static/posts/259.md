# the kimerran logs - Chapter Change (2013)

published: Apr 30, 2013

Actively exploring.Â TargetingÂ a web development role (follows methodologies).

Lots of financial challenges. Mid-20â€²s dilemma? Hope not.

Never forget to read [goals ][1]and [mindset][2]Â daily.

> I don't mind paying the price for success.
I know that to achieve much, one must pay much. I am willing to
make sacrifices in order to see my dreams come true. I accept the
principle of delayed gratification. I don't need 'instant' anything. I
can handle paying now and enjoying later.
