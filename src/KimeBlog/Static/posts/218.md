# the kimerran logs - Lugaw with Egg at Lugaw Republic

published: Sep 9, 2012

One of my favorite comfort foods is Lugaw or rice congee. Lugaw is a type of rice porridge popular in many Asian countries like the Philippines. It is prepared by boiling rice in a large amount of water until it finally softens significantly. You can use either in a pot or in a rice cooker.Â Whether you want something hot or just want something to fill-in your stomach, why not try Lugaw Republic?

After my shopping for grocery during the day, I suddenly got hungry and I saw one of Lugaw Republic's outlets at the food court.I ordered lugaw with egg (they named it egg-caldo) while my sister had a plain lugaw. The plain one costs 25 pesos while the one with egg costs 32 pesos.

Lugaw Republic serves one of the best rice congee in the metro. You can often find them at food carts or kiosks in the malls. Other than lugaw (rice congee), they also serve Goto Espesyal, Arroz Caldo (rice congee with chicken bits), as well ask puto, kwek-kwek, okoy, tokwa't baboy, lumpia toge, tokwa, and tukneneng.

They have already around 28 franchisees in two years and have already 25 outlets to find nationwide. What they boasts is the idea of having the biggest profit margin above all other food cart business, hence the term 'tubong lugaw'.
