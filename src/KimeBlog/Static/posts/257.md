# the kimerran logs - Another personal blog renovation

published: Apr 6, 2013

I can't remember how many times this personal blog of mine has been renovated. From changing of blogging services, from free subdomains to my own domain and from one location to another. I just made a change again and let's hope this would be for a longer time Â now.

I'll have the home page [markhughneri.com][1] reserved for something professional (still working on it). Maybe a landing page where visitors can see 'Special Offer â€“ Buy now for only 25 pesos'. Me for 25 pesos? No.

I am currently having trouble with getting this site indexed. I deleted this from index using robots.txt â€“ maybe that's why now its taking too long before it gets indexed again. Oh well, doesn't matter since I don't really want to publicize this blog.

I also created a Fanpage for myself (well, for this blog actually). ASA-AdU website will be relaunched (again). This time I hope there will be article writers. Speaking of article writers, I am planning to outsource writers for Money Gizmo at $2 / article. Hmmm?

OK I guess it's time to sleep. Too much work for today. :p
