# the kimerran logs - Close All But This

published: Sep 19, 2013

I am writing this blog while I am coding my first game in Windows Phone (but not the first one to be published I think). This project is a XAML + XNA one.

Here are the technologies used in this little project:

* C# (2nd time I used this language in a project)
* Visual Studio 2012
* Windows Phone 8 SDK (but the target device is Windows Phone 7)
* XNA
* Coffee and Softdrinks

Planning to buy a Lumia 520. I am yet to decide if I am going to buy a new cellphone (a Windows Phone 8 one) since I am going to build some mobile applications for my blog and some I would try to sell. The 520 is the cheapest and weakest one which means if I can make it running on this device, then it should run in every Windows Phone out there.

Wait for Windows Phone 9? I think not yet, I've read they will have it around 2015 or late 2014. We don't know. But Â speculations are, there will just be one core used in the mobile (Windows Phone) and the desktop (Windows) versions. So, I am smelling good news for developers. One code, deploy to all! Sounds like Xamarin, MonoGame, Unity.

Read book â€“ Code Complete. Thinking if I should buy from Amazon. And have it shipped here in Malaysia. But unfortunately, the shipping fee makes the price double. Think.

Draft of a first start-up wannabe project is currently on progress. There goes the features, database design, modules, goals, some resources, technologies to be used. Very informal draft.

[Getting inspiration from Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood][3]. By listening to their podcasts and reading a lot of articles from their blog. If you are a software developer and pretty passionate on it and wants to improve yourself, you got to check out their blogs.

What's New in the Microsoft Stack? Windows 8.1 (or Windows 8 SP1). Visual Studio 2013. Windows Phone GDR3 Update (soon).

Ok. Back to coding.
