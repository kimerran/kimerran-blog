# the kimerran logs - Goto King Special Goto

published: Jun 26, 2012

Yes! I am a fan of Lugaw, Goto, Arroz Caldo â€“ whatever you call it. From the vendors in Baclaran to the lugawan you can find in Malls, I eat LUGAW!!!Â Today, June 26, I submitted some of the requirements but unfortunately I am not able to open a new bank account since I need an NBI clearance that will act as my valid ID. So, planning to go to the Robinson's Galleria, I took off at Megamall instead hoping that there's an NBI office there (unfortunately â€“ none).

Went to the food court and as usual, there's a million of choices. After some minutes of pondering where to eat, I decided to eat lugaw at Goto King.

![Yummy][1]![Yummy][3]

You can have their Special Goto for 60 pesos and a 16 ounce softdrinks for 28 pesos. What's in a 'special' goto? Well, the usual â€“ spring onions, chicharon, hard boiled egg then you mixed it with patis, pepper and calamansi.Â During bad weathers, it's nice to eat and munch on this lugaw/goto/arroz caldo â€“ whatever you call it! ![:P][1]
