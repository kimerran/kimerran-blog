# the kimerran logs - Hainanese Delights

published: Aug 6, 2012

![hainanese delights][1]

![hainanese delights][2]We just came from the Sunday service at Victory Pioneer and as always we had a great time discovering more of Jesus.Â Trisha and I decided to have our early dinner at Hainanese Delights at Robinson's Forum.

We just went to try out their rice dishes which came with unlimited rice just like Mang Inasal. And we were not mistaken with the delicious food they served us.

At first I thought they have waiters but unfortunately you have to order by the counter but there isn't no hassle since it's a bit early and there's only few diners at the moment.

### Hainanese Delight Experience

While you wait for your order, a free soup will be served as appetizer â€“ hototay soup in our case according to Trisha. We ordered Hainan Fried Chicken which you can choose breast part and savored with Hainan sauce and Chicken Heaven which is chicken's leg and thigh part marinated in BBQ sauce. Each of our order costs 120 pesos and comes with unlimited Hainanese rice.

All rice meals comes with unlimited Hainanese rice. And the flavor of the rice really plays well with the chicken in our orders. According to the wall poster,Â Hainanese dish origins comes with many variations but its origins lie in a small island off the coast of mainland China. The flavor bursts with symphony of flavors and is specially prepared to absorb the unique stock flavor of the dish making it delightful and delicious.

Aside from the rice dishes which costs 120 pesos each, there are also dumpling orders for 90 pesos. Noodles costs 80-120 pesos while the Hainan rice itself costs 40 pesos. Drinks costs 35 pesos for in-can softdrinks.

We came out of there with full stomachs. I guess I'll be trying out their dumpling dishes soon. Check out pictures below.
