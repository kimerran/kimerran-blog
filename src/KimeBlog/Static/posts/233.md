# the kimerran logs - Mango-Ong Carabao Mango

published: Nov 25, 2012

One of the favorite foods of Filipinos is the combination of green mango and bagoong. Big or small cuts of our very own carabao mango is dipped with salty but delicious bagoong. This snack can be served as a snack or even partnered with beer and liquors.

I still remember buying from the market and have my mother prepare this kind of snack to us or even buying from the streets and partnered with very spicy bagoong alamang.Â Those that I bought from the streets are served in sticks and kept in big glass jars to maintain its freshness.

Â Would you believe if I say to you that they brought this Filipino-favorite at the malls?

### Here comes Mango-Ong

Recently I saw a food-cart selling the same mango-bagoong combination that I've craved for a while. It is not served in sticks anymore but in boxes. Mango-Ong is a food cart business that sells fresh green mangoes and singkamas partnered with sweet or spicy bagoong alamang.

A box of green mangoes costs 20 pesos (already served with a tablespoon of bagoong). If you want more bagoong, you have to add 3 pesos per tablespoon.Â You can also order singkamas for only 10 pesos. Extra scoop of bagoong costs 2 pesos. You also can choose how your bagoong will taste like â€“ sweet, spicy or extra spicy.

Though I am expecting a sweet carabao mango, I was served by a very sour one. And one funny thing is, the lady in the picture won't allow me to take pictures for some reason. I guess they don't like free advertising (yet?).
