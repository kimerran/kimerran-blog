I always dreamed of being an instructor and i am experiencing it right now as I'm one of the trainers for my co-employees at Narra Systems. Yesterday we have discussed about object oriented programming in Perl and how you automate configurations using Perl Expect.

We did a lot of question and answer stuff. And of course, laboratory exercises. we also did it on an "english-only-policy" which made the challenge to me as a trainer harder. I need to explain these stuffs, which i myself haven't mastered yet plus i must express it simple in English.

And today, I have taught them how to configure Cisco routers from the terminal. What are the different modes, how to configure the interfaces, IP addressing, subnet masks, static routing, dynamic routing, RIP, RIPv2 and how to do all of these in packet tracer.

It was a tiring day and got home wet because of the rain. Made a wise decision of buying cheese burgers rather than an umbrella. And i just love it when it rains.

NP: when it rains by paramore. And i am drinking coffee as i write this entry.
