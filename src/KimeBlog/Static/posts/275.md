# How to Validate A Year in ASP.NET WebForm

![ASP NET LOGO][1]![ASP NET LOGO][2]So, you are assigned to put a validation wherein a Text Box should only accept valid 'year' values. One solution for this is to check the length of the text box to be exactly 4-digits and all should be numeric. After checking, you will have to inform the user by creating a label where your 'validation message' will be shown. Sounds easy right?

Though the given solution above works, Â this might not be the best solution for your problem. In ASP.NET Web Forms, you can use [several validation controls][3]Â to do this task.

In the code below we have use an ASP.NET Validation Control â€“ Regular Expression Validator. This validator checks if the ControlToValidate's content matches the format given in the ValidationExpression.

It will also show a message as described in ErrorMessage if the validation fails.





Which method do you prefer?
