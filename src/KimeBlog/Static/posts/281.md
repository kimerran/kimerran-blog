# Reasons Why Develop for Windows Phone

A lot of friends has been asking why did I chose to create mobile applications in the Windows Phone platform instead of Google's Android OS or even the Apple's iOS. So, here's a short list of my reasons why I chose to develop with what they say â€” Â 'Microsoft's dying platform'.

#1 â€“ I know Microsoft.NET. Since I am already developing .NET whether it's a desktop application using Winforms or WPF, or maybe a web application using Webforms or MVC, why not utilize the same skill set in developing a mobile application. You can either use Visual Basic .NET or C# to create Windows Phone apps. And since I have used XAML in developing WPF applications, I can use the same skills in developing the UI for Windows Phone apps as well.

#2 â€“ Competition. If you are going to start creating an app for either Android or iOS, chances are there is already an existing application similar to what you are going to make. Since the Windows Phone store is not that 'mature' yet, then why not grab this opportunity? Another idea is, since some official apps have not been ported to Windows Phone OS (such as Instagram), why not create one for it?

#3 â€“ Porting to other platform. I am not pretty sure if you can take your Java code and port it to iOS or Windows Phone but I know that it is possible to get your C# up and running to both Android and iOS. And what's cool is you can use Visual Studio for all of that. How? Use [Xamarin][3]. If you wanted your app to deploy on the most popular mobile platforms, they you might want to check their product.

#4 â€“ Easier to create apps. Would you believe that it is easier to create a Windows Phone apps than Android or iOS? If you don't believe it, here's a video showing what I mean.

#5 â€“ Cheapest to publish. If you wanted users to install your app, you need to publish it on the market â€“ App Store, Play Store or Windows Phone store. Well, it doesn't come without a price. For Android, you need to have $25 and for Apple iOS that's $99 per year. But, if you want to publish in the Windows Phone store, you will only need to spend [$19 for a Windows Phone developer account][4] to do so.

#6 â€“ One OS. Soon, there will only be one OS regardless of what device you use â€“ desktop, tablet or phone. Wouldn't it be great if what you create for the phone can be used also in the tablet and desktop. And the Windows desktop OS is not a minor player in this field. More devices = more users = more profits for developers, right?



So, there you go. My reasons on why I chose to develop for Windows Phone and not Android or iOS. Â If you would ask, there's another reason why I can't develop for iOS â€“ I don't have a Mac and have no plans of building a Hackintosh yet.Â PS. Actually, the Windows Phone OS has grown so much over these past years and with the recent deal of buying Nokia, I am excited on what's next for the platform.
