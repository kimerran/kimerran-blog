# the kimerran logs - North Park Yang Chow and Chicken Pops

published: Jun 28, 2012

We watched Kimi Dora 2 and the Temple of Kiyeme at Greenbelt 1. I just discovered that movie tickets are cheaper there. After the movie, we went to North Park at Glorietta to have dinner. It's our monthsary today so we deserve to eat something we don't usually eat. :p

We have Yang Chow rice, Boneless Chicken pops, Iced tea and four seasons for drinks.
