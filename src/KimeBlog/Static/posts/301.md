At this point, you are now familiar with several methods that you can do with your SQL Server database. You know how to retrieve records, add records and even update records. But what if you want to remove some of your records. On this tutorial, I will teach you how to perform a DELETE method to your database using ADO.NET.

This tutorial is still part of the series "[Simple .NET Database Tutorial using ADO.NET][1]". If you have not yet prepared your database, I suggest starting with [Preparation][2] and follow the series in order  [Create][3], [Read][4], and [Update][5].

Now, let's learn the last and final method  Database Delete.

1\. Starting with the project that we left with our 'Update' method, we add a new button and named it btnDelete. We also modified the text property to 'Delete'.

2\. Now, double-click the button to generate the event handler. Â Type the code as shown below. The DELETE SQL query is quite simple as you may notice. We still used the variable from the last tutorial in order to determine the Id of the currently selected Employee.
