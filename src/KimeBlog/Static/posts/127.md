was assigned the multicast vpn test case under the PV project. took me a while to really understand how this thing is configured. i have to study how to configure OSPF, BGP, an MPLS (LDP or RSVP), PIM. i have to make all routers up on every protocol. wish sir frank finished it already cause he was told to assist me yesterday.

july 15 – thursday. watched a 15 peso movie with narra peepz. invited mariz to come over. and was asked to do night shift ( 10pm-7am ). so, i am awake for more than 24 hours. consumed two bottles of gatorade. don't know if it's good for the health but somehow made me survive.

july 16 – friday. bought book two of percy jackson – the sea of monsters. had a movie with mariz. sorcerer's apprentice is a good movie, for kids. had my shift at night again. hope it's the last time that i will be asked to do graveyard work. i have to stop seeing her and watching movies with her. at least i know, it cannot be.

july 17 – saturday. slept half of the day. downloaded and watched lightning thief movie. had a chat with mj =). wish to meet her in person.
