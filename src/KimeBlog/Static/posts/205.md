# the kimerran logs - Carbonara Platter, Mojos N Dip and Mango Juice at Shakeyâ€™s Market Market

published: Jul 29, 2012

An extension of our love celebration for the month, we had our merienda/early dinner at Shakey's Market-Market.

We had a Carbonara Platter and Mojos N Dip. They are Trisha's favorite at Shakey's. You can have the carbonara platter for 299 pesos. It is 'sulit' as compared to having solo's for each one of us. I believe the platter is already good for 3 persons.

Mojos N Dip is for 95 pesos only. We had Mango juice for drinks at 79 pesos each.
