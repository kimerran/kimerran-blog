##I thought Play is slow on my machine.
So I found myself interested in learning [Scala + Play framework][1]. Fired up a vagrant box and installed [pre-requisites][2] (you will need JDK since Scala uses the JVM).

After successful installation, got myself into creating my very first Play app by issuing the command:
```
activator new test1
```
Where __activator__ is the location of the __Typesafe Activator__ you downloaded from [here][3]. And then I tried to run __activator run__ then I noticed it took a while before the web application ran.

Luckily, [someone answered][4] from __Malaysia Scala Group__ that the first time I run Play, it will download a bunch of files. The second time I create a test application, it's faster!

And here goes Play framework up and running on my Vagrant box.

##Ghost issues you might encounter

Thought I might [give Ghost blog a try][8]. Ghost runs on Node.js and it needs a [specific version][5]. 

__My Setup__: Ubuntu 12.04 on a Vagrant box.

__Issues encountered__: Cannot install Ghost due to the following reasons:

1\. I can only install Node.js version 0.6 on Ubuntu 12.04
2\. After solving issue above, installing Ghost using the command __npm install --production__ still fails

__Solution__:

1\. To solve Node.js version issue on Ubuntu 12.04, follow instructions [here][6]. Basically you just need to add a new apt repository and download nodejs from there. You might need to remove any other version of Node.js before you proceed.
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties python g++ make nodejs
```

2\. The next issue is caused by a bug in npm when it's creating a 'symbolic link' on a Vagrant box's mounted folder (default is _/vagrant_) as [discussed here][7]. To solve this issue, copy the Ghost directory to a non-mounted directory.


After solving these issues, I was able to install Ghost blog!
