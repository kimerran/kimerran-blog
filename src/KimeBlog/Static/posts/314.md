This is a short tutorial on how I was able to run a Rails application on __nginx__ using [passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/). This is on the assumption that you have already installed Rails on your machine and have a running Ruby on Rails application.
![nginx logo](http://static.kimerran.com/img/blog/nginx-logo.jpg)

1\. Install nginx. It's a reverse-proxy server focused on __high concurrency, high performance and low memory usage__ (sweeeeeeeeeet)! [What is nginx?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx)
```
apt-get install nginx
```
2\. Copy nginx init script. It's pre-configured you might want to edit it.
```
$ cd
$ git clone git://github.com/jnstq/rails-nginx-passenger-ubuntu.git
$ sudo mv rails-nginx-passenger-ubuntu/nginx/nginx /etc/init.d/nginx
$ sudo chown root:root /etc/init.d/nginx
```

3\. Install passenger gem and it's nginx module
```
gem install passenger

rvmsudo passenger-install-nginx-module
```

4\. Locate your _nginx.conf_ file and edit the following _server_ block. <br/>
Legend:<br/>
- __server_name__ -  localhost or domain name<br/>
- __root__ - <i>public</i> folder of your Rails application<br/>
- __listen__ - port to access your app. default to HTTP (port 80)
```
server {
	listen 80;
	server_name bloodlyf.app;
	passenger_enabled on;
	rails_env development;
	root /var/ror/bloodlyf/public;
}
```
5\. Start or restart nginx. Go to port 80 or __server\_name__ and you should be seeing your Rails app you provided on your __root__ configuration.
```
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```
