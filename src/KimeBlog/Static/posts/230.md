# the kimerran logs - Beef Wanton â€“ Paotsin Dim Sum Restaurant

published: Nov 17, 2012

It's grocery time today so after that Â my sister got hungry and asked if I could treat her lunch and she picked Beef Wanton from Paotsin. She bought a dimsum and rice meal for only 50 pesos from Paotsin which is one of the biggest dim sum restaurant in the Philippines.

Back in my college years, I also buy Paotsin meals for lunch. If I'm not mistaken, the meal only costs 40-50 pesos inclusive of dimsum, rice, and a cold ice-tea. That's already a great deal especially to students. And today, even as a working professional, I still eat their all-time favorite dimsum meals.

Paotsin's specialty is their dumplings and wantons. You can choose asian chicken dumpling, spicy fish dumpling, scallop dumpling, pork dumpling, sharks fin or shrimp, squid, scallop, beef and crab wantons. Then you can partner it with hainanese rice and a cold cup of iced tea and you're good to go. Check out there menu below and try it out for yourself.

## Franchise a Dim Sum Restaurant like Paotsin

I have found out (by a quick Google search) that Paotsin is ran as a family business and is currently not open for franchise. If you really want to open a dim sum restaurant or similar type of business, then I guess you can check out other options or create a new business offering similar kind of foods but you have to make a different taste.

Paotsin is one of the best dim sum restaurant here in the Philippines and is worth a try. If you are hungry and is looking for a cheap place to eat some delicious dim sum meals, then Paotsin is a good place to go. Have a try!
