# the kimerran logs - Comfort food indoors: Blueberry cheese sandwich.

published: Jul 30, 2012

Here comes the rainy season, most of us cannot go out, some of us crave for mouthwatering comfort food we can enjoy indoors. An idea great for the season; Blueberry and Cream Cheese, how to do it?

Spread Blueberry on a slice of loaf, remember : the more you put the mouth waterier it gets and on another loaf spread cream cheese the more the softer and the tastier the bread gets. Put them together and toast for 3 minutes until the shallow layer of the bread changes to soft brown colour.

Serve hot and delectable!

On your own preference you may slice the loaves in bite size to avoid stains and for unmessed eating.

I assure you this tastes the same as those expensive branded bakeshops comfortably at home, what are you waiting for? Get cozy, try it now! ![:D][7]
