# the kimerran logs - Gong Cha â€“ Still the Best Milktea for Us

published: Jun 23, 2012

Here's a post for my and Trisha's favorite Milktea in town. Just as promised, I treat her with a large Winter Melon milktea. Just went to Clinica Manila at SM Megamall to have my medical exam. Straight to MOA for a Gong Cha!

Â Trisha and I had our first taste of Gong Cha Milk Tea at Food Choices and since then (when the craving comes and when there's budget), we will go looking for the closest branch and sip on our favorite.
How about you? What's your favorite Gong Cha milktea?
