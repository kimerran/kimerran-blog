my friend and i went on a friendly date june 5 2010. watched prince of persia. coincidentally, our office mate who are also dating each other was there too.

we went to seaside, walk, buy some snacks, and ate viewing the ice-skating rink. i've never been happier like that after three years.

wish we can be more than that but i guess that's it.

and i just realized – dreaming won't do any good. especially in love. you just have to be realistic. have to focus on something else. don't have to let it bother my work and my goals for my self. maybe just not the time for this. but when?
vanilla twilight. nice song. but these lines won't be true – at least for me.<br/>
I don't feel so alone.<br/>
I don't feel so alone.<br/>
I don't feel so alone.<br/>
