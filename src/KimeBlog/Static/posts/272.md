# Blogs That Every Programmer / Developer Should Read

[Â Home][1]Â >Â [Featured][2]Â >Â Blogs That Every Programmer / Developer Should Read

![more joel on software][3]![more joel on software][4]When I don't write code, I read 'em. Yes, I am such a bookworm. I just love reading. Back in elementary you can already see me spending some time in the library. I also save money to buy some comics (those horror comics in Tagalog). I also prefer to read about comets, planets, dinosaurs and other Science-and-illustrated books back then.

In High School, I read K-Zone (and collect some). Childish, right.

In College, I started to collect PC-Mag. Though I was not able to continue collecting it, it was one of the magazines which I read front to back and read some of the articles more than one time. That was my addiction. Computer, technology, the latest and greatest. I don't know but I think they stopped publishing in the Philippines.

Right now, no more magazine collections, no more K-zone kiddie magazine and no more horror comics. I guess that's what you get from growing up.

E-books about tech replaced them. There are a lot of free e-books published in the internet. [Even Microsoft has a bunch of them][5]. But e-books are sometimes not fun to read. Especially the 'technical' ones.

Here's a secret to mastering a subject. Read the book at least three times. First reading, just scan and skim. On the second reading, read each paragraph but stop once you get the point. During the last reading, do the hands-on. Practice what you learned and use the book as a reference.

OK. Enough of that. If you will ask me what blogs I read (related to software development and general programming) at least once a week, then here's the complete list.

    * [Scott Hanselman][6]Â (http://www.hanselman.com). Scott is a remote-employee from Microsoft specifically working with the Web Platform team. I often see him in video presentations and he is a frustrated stand-up comedian (aka a great speaker). Who wants a boring presenter? If you want to be updated about the latest from Microsoft and want to have it in a 'lighter' and easy-to-understand tone, then this blog is for you.

Â 

    * [Joel on Software][7] (http://www.joelonsoftware.com). I bought a 25-peso (~$0.50) book from Book Sale entitled "More Joel on Software". It's an eye opener. If you are a coder, tester, programmer, team lead, developer or a wannabe on whatever language and platform, I strongly suggest that you read this one. Or at least his blog since the contents of the book are taken from his blog. This blog is authored by Joel Spolsky, CEO and co-founder of StackOverflow.

Â 

    * [Coding Horror][8] (http://www.codinghorror.com). Just like Joel on Software, Coding Horror talks about programming in general. The thoughts are witty. Period. It is authored by Jeff Atwood, co-founder of StackOverflow.

Â 



See, I am a big fan of StackOverflow. I bet you will agree with me if I say that it was one of the few very useful site in the internet (not only to developers but to everyone c/o Stack Exchange).

Reading articles from these three guys makes me a day wiser than yesterday. So, I want to share these to you if you haven't checked their blogs yet.

What about you? What are your favorite and most-often-read technical / non-technical blogs. Comment out below. ![:\)][3]

PS. I love reading Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and the Game of Thrones, too.
