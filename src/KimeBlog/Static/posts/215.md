# the kimerran logs - 3rd Week of August 2012

published: Aug 21, 2012

It's like my first holiday since I started working. August 20 and 21 (Monday and Tuesday) are both Philippine national holidays. (And I am watching Resident Evil Afterlife while blogging this).

I am on a hyper mode again at work since I discovered that our role will not be plainly software developers but we are going to be engaged in a 'project management' type of work since we are part of a team that does that kind of job. So, I am a bit excited to come to work this week because of this.

Last Saturday we went to Casimiro at Las Pinas because Trisha and her groupmates work on their project. Then we ate at SM South Mall's food court. We had a long travel, from Mall of Asia to Casimiro to SM Southmall to Alabang up to Astra, Sucat, Paranaque. I also inquired the availability of Catching Fire (Book 2 of the Hunger Games series) but still out of stock.

At Trisha's house we watched Wrath of the Titans at their newly bought 32-inch television. Movie is great especially when you watch it at a big screen.

The long weekend's not over yet, on Sunday we went to mass at a church at Multinational village before we went to Molino, Cavite to attend [Nanay Connie's 60th Birthday][1].

During the Monday, I gave my father an early birthday treat. We went to see Bourne Legacy at Mall of Asia together with my mother and Trisha.

Just had a great long weekend for the first time. Guess I am ready for the upcoming week. ![:\)][2]
