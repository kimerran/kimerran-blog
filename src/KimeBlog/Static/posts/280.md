# LongListSelector from Windows Phone Toolkit Doesn't Show my Items (SOLVED)

[Â Home][1]Â >Â [Windows Phone][2]Â >Â LongListSelector from Windows Phone Toolkit Doesn't Show my Items (SOLVED)

![windows phone longlistselector][3]![windows phone longlistselector][4]While porting (downgrading) my first Windows phone application â€“ [Philippine Holidays][5] to WP Mango, I had encountered a problem. First, what to use to replace the LongListSelector control. We all know that this control only comes with Windows Phone 8 but some good guys have created one you can use for your Mango projects through the [Windows Phone Toolkit][6]. I installed the toolkit using Nuget and my first problem is solved.


I thought that back-porting the project to Windows Phone 7 will be as easy as removing the capability to save the holiday items to the calendar since this is not yet supported as of Windows Phone 7, and replacing the LongListSelector since this control is not yet present in the said version. But, I was wrong.

The list of holidays is not showing in the Panorama control. At first I thought that the problem was I was not able to properly reference my DataTemplate but that was not the case. There is nothing wrong with my DataTemplateÂ .

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 

SOLUTION:

After several tries of solving this issue with the help of Google, I was able to find this [blog][7] and noticed that the LongListSelector has a property calledÂ IsFlatList which you should set to True if you wanted a flat list.

Well, I guess the tool kit's version of theÂ LongListSelector is supposed to be used as described in that article.Â It seems that the itÂ has a Â 'structure' that is a bit different from the Windows Phone 8â€²s version.

What I did is I added the code that sets the property of the IsFlatList to true.Â And this single line of code helped me solve my problem. ![:\)][3]

![:\)][8]

' Sets the template for the list Me.ItemTemplate = App.Current.Resources("HolidayItemTemplate") Me.IsFlatList = True ' Gets list of holiday according the the month Me.ItemsSource = _GetDataByMonthNumber(MonthNumber)

Â Â Â Â Â Â  ' Sets the template for the list

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Me.ItemTemplate = App.Current.Resources("HolidayItemTemplate")

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Me.IsFlatList = True

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ' Gets list of holiday according the the month

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Me.ItemsSource = _GetDataByMonthNumber(MonthNumber)



LESSON LEARNED:Â Â If you plan to target Windows Phone 7 users, always start with a Windows Phone 7 project. The upgrade will be easier.
