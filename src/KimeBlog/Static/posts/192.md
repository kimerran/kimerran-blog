# the kimerran logs - A Veneto Pizzeria Ristorante

published: Jul 21, 2012

I reunited with my team mates from college today. We called ourselves Borateam and been groupmates and friends since my 3rd year at college.Â One of the team had promised us a Pizza treat if we will pass our thesis and fortunately we did and now we are all working and doing great.

After 2 years, we met and finally had our pizza treat from Sugar. We spent the afternoon playing bowling where almost everyone is a first-timer. After that, we proceed to A Veneto Pizzeria Ristorante at SM Mall of Asia near the sea-side.

Of course we had our pizza. We had a 16-inch pizza where half the flavor is Bacon Cheeseburger and the other one (not sure) is the Vegetarian pizza. A slice would cost you from 85 to 100 pesos. A 10-inch costs 230 to 270 pesos while 14 inches pizza is from 360 to 440 pesos and their biggest size (16-inches) will be at 475 to 615 pesos.

Aside from that, we had carbonara, spaghetti and one of their best sellers- Chicken Wings which at first I thought was very spicy but indeed is a mixture of spicy and sweetness.

A plate of carbonara will cost you 255 pesos while the spaghetti is from 250 to 300 pesos. A serving of chicken wings costs 170 pesos.

The carbonara is great and the spaghetti's sauce tastes real tomato. I will definitely eat again if there would be chance. Visit them at SM Mall of Asia.
