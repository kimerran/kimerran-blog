it was just im not born into this kind of "romantic" setups. im born to be something. just be something. not someone to anyone.

i just want to decide right now. maybe "love" was not just my stuff. a friend once told me that i easily get into "liking" someone. well, that's just me. but in the end, im the one who got hurt (always). im too fragile for these "feelings" stuff.

i need to seek some advice. cause right now, im going to focus on my career. i just want to be somebody. on my own. maybe, i was just pressured by peers. i need to get a life out of the routers, switches, and scripts that challenges me everyday of the week.

i just really want someone to understand. someone to share what my ideals are. someone who can bring the smile upon me. someone who can like me too for what i am. for what i have. for what i got. for what i know. for what i can do. for what i can be. this really mess my schedule for tonight. i was suppose to finish something.

my damn guitar is out of tune again. i wish my ex can sing for me again. but that ain't gonna happen. and so, i have to sing on my own.

i just got too excited. ended up â€“ none.
