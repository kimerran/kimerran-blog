when will be the right time?

i know, somewhere deep inside me was a soul looking for another soul. i want to keep in believing that someday im going to find someone who can make my world a lot bigger. here i am counting days before my twenty-second birthday. what i trust is the lord's plan. i have to wait. wait for the right time and the right place. there's a lot to learn.

i was already dumped a lot of times. actually, some haven't started yet but signs of unlikeness are shown. i don't like having self-pity again. that was so immature. i have been told im so desperate. but, at least im not fake. i don't want to hide what i really feel. at least i put it in writing, a poem, or a song. i play the guitar, even without lyrics, even without the correct tune. i sang songs, songs of sadness, songs of defeat.

speaking of appreciation, hey~ i am appreciated. at office : i was one of the best – they say. at singing : lei and shane just told me i have a great voice. for my new found friend (mj) : keep it going bf. i hope we get along well, in person or not. =)

on another things, i want to learn how to play the violin or at least the piano. i was a fan of silent sanctuary for the violin. for the piano part, i just love music.
