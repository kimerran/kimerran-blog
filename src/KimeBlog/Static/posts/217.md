# the kimerran logs - 1st Week of September 2012

published: Sep 9, 2012

It's been a long time since I wrote here. I've been busy with work since my first day at my new company. The highlight for this week would be when I've been tasked to share my knowledge in VB .NET and I have designed an OOP structure for one of our big projects.

This Saturday I attended Adamson Computer Science General Assembly because Trisha's part of a dance number. They called their group Project X Movers. See the pictures [here][1]. Actually they were the best performance during the event which made them win first prize.Â

I have a slow Sunday and felt pretty bad since I was not able to attend Sunday service. Just end up watching Naruto anime and reading Game of Thrones book one. Later afternoon I went to SM to buy groceries with my sister. I had lugaw from [Lugaw Republic][4] and bibingka from [Bibingkinitan][5] for my merienda.

Will read again to make myself sleepy, I really want to read the next book in the series. Guess I am ready for the next busy work week.
