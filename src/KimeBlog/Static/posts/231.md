# the kimerran logs - World Chicken at Glorietta Food Choices

published: Nov 17, 2012

So today after the grocery, Trisha and I went to see the last part of the Twilight Saga -Breaking Dawn. I was not really a fan of the Twilight movie series but my girlfriend does. I only like the fight and battle scenes especially the last part.

We were both hungry after watching the movie so we decided to have our dinner at Food Choices at Glorietta. Last time we ate at World Chicken, I ordered 'Chicken Inasal' for both of us so this time we tried what most people order â€“ a Quarter chicken meal with two sidings.

Â 

## How to create your platter at World Chicken

1\. You will be ordering a Quarter chicken meal

2\. Decide whether you wanted a single or double sidings. The two sidings will cost you 168 pesos while a single siding will cost about 132 pesos

3\. Select from any of available sidings (note that the availability may have changed):

* Bacon fried rice
* Asian noodle
* Fettucine
* Plain rice
* Japanese rice

4\. Choose your sauce from any of the following:

* BBQ sauce
* Brown gravy
* Teriyaki sauce
* Corn and mushroom

5\. You can also add 30 pesos for a regular size iced tea

Trisha and I had a single serving of a Quarter chicken meal with fettucine and japanese rice for the sidings. I would highly recommend this meal for pasta-chicken lovers and it is definitely worth the money.
