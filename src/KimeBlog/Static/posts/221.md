# the kimerran logs - Sizzling Plateâ€™s Sizzling Sisig at MOA

published: Sep 16, 2012

If I can remember well, my first try of Sizzling Plate was during college at SM Center Point. I ordered a Bursilog which is a burger steak that has the size of a plate. Sizzling Plate serves grilled meat delights in a sizzling plate while your food is still hot in the plate. It then dries up the sauce and further cooks the meat on it.

I tried it again, this time I ordered Sizzling Sisig with fried rice and drinks for 108 pesos only. One of my favorite Filipino food is sizzling sisig. The term sisig is a Kapampangan term which means to snack on something sour. Sizzling sisig is a Filipino dish made from a pig's head and liver and seasoned with calamansi and chili peppers.

Sisig is one of my favorite foods including Kare-kare and Dinuguan and Bopis. You can't deny that this site is also named after that. ![:\)][3]

## The Sizzling Plate score

Personally, if I am to compare their sisig with other sisigs that I already tasted, their sisig is not that delicious. Must be because I prefer to eat 'dry' sisig than those swimming in sauce. But still, I would recommend you to try it and their other grilled meat dishes such as pork steak, porterhouse steak and pork chops.

For its price at only 108 pesos, its definitely worth the buck. You can find them on most SM Mall Food Courts.
