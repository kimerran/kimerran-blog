it's another day here at pfizer. just ate lunch at LKG tower. 

today's the graduation day. im not that excited. maybe because even after the graduation i will still be here at pfizer – cause my internship's extended till june 11. 

tomorrow i will be at school to enroll then after that, my asa-adu family will have a reunion. will be watching movie with the guys i really miss. looking forward to it because sir tyler will be coming too. the day's really slow…
