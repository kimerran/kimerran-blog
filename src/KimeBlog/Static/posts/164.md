# the kimerran logs - Serenitea Milk Tea

published: Jun 17, 2012

We are supposed to get a free membership at Resort's World Manila but unfortunately our ID's are not accepted. It was also my first time to enter the Casino of the mall and my first time to ever enter a casino since I only see the slot machines and the likes in movies. Since we have nothing to do there, we decided to take merienda and have chosen Serenitea.

We asked what's their best sellers and they answered that it is the Okinawa Milk Tea so I ordered one large size for 105 pesos. Trisha ordered another best seller as suggested by the crew â€“ the Malty Choco milk tea. They also asked us if how much sugar do we want. You choose from 50, 75 or 100.

In contrast with another Milk Tea product, you can really taste the tea in it. Or might be because we just chose 75 for the sugar level. But all in all, the taste is great and refreshing. Worth the money. Here are some of the pictures.

Try it out for yourself! Let me know if the taste is just right for you.
