# the kimerran logs - One tough week

published: Feb 16, 2013

Yes! The week's finally over. A lot has happened since last week and I hope that everything's only a 'trial' just like when you are having a 'trial period' when using a try-ware software.

Speaking of 'trial period', my trial period for one keyword research tool I am currently tinkering on â€“ Market Samurai â€“ has expired. Luckily, there's a 'cheat' way to re-enable that trial period. You just have to register for another trial period using another e-mail address. But, don't jump ahead because that would be tedious for you and me. You don't have to register a new e-mail address just to try out the tool. Just get a disposable mail from Melt Mail.

Still not done from preparing [Sisig Bytes][1] â€“ my next blog site and hopefully the last generic site that I will be creating. I also drafted some idea about a trusted examination platform (eggxamr) and an interest-driven social network (hatcheet). Looking forward to hatching these eggs. Also, I've done some research that micro-niche marketing is a dying industry â€“ at least that's what they think in a thread at Warrior Forums.

I will be transferring Money Gizmo to my BH account. Having two hosts is not really economical. That's what you get when you are only starting from blogging and website stuffs. It'll cost you some bucks. BH will have a VPS offering soon, but I will not be needing that soon. It's just a good news that I don't need to transfer again if time comes.

I also worked on a four-letter word + r research today. Using some search and Go Daddy's bulk registration tool. And I have shortlisted some domain names which I am thinking to be generic niche sites as well â€“ sulkr.com (yeah sulking), huffr.com (sounds like you're smoking something) and guglr.com (liquid choke).

Next Monday-Friday will be ASP.NET training day. Looking forward to a fruitful training! New thing for me.

I am a bit hungry now and laptop's battery is already low, so I guess this is it for now. ![:\)][2]
