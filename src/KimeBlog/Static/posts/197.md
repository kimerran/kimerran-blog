# the kimerran logs - Greekâ€™s Shawarma Rice

published: Jul 25, 2012

It was actually my 2nd time to try Shawarma. My first time was during my work at Narra Systems and I did not actually liked the taste of it. So, here we go trying out Greek's Shawarma Rice.

You can have one shawarma rice for 50 pesos but if you order two, you will only pay 90 pesos. I like the taste and makes me full. Might be because of the rice. Some would say it's not healthy because of the meat but I think the vegetables will balance it off.
