# the kimerran logs - Church of Our Lady of Fatima

published: Sep 3, 2013
Another Catholic Church in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia is the Church of Our Lady of Fatima. I go here every Sunday to attend mass. They have one English mass at 10:30 AM. Since the church is in the vicinity of Brickfields, you will notice that a lot of people who attend the mass are Indians. It is also the reason why there is a Tamil mass at 8:30 AM. Check the note below to see the complete schedule of mass in Church of Our Lady of Fatima.
