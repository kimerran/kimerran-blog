Saying goodbye now?<br/>
Tears ran down my face<br/>
Are you happy now?<br/>
Now that you're free<br/>
And not thinking of me anymore<br/>

Wish I may<br/>
Wish I could turn back the hands of time<br/>
Ten years is not long enough<br/>
To show and to say<br/>
That I'll love you this way until now<br/>

Letting go now?<br/>
Leaving the memories behind<br/>
Fly away and I won't ask you to stay<br/>
Cause I know you've decided<br/>
And feelings are faded goodbye<br/>

Wish I may<br/>
Wish I could turn back the hands of time<br/>
Ten years is not long enough<br/>
To show and to say<br/>
That I'll love you this way until now<br/>
