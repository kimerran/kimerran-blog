# Simple .NET Database Tutorial using ADO.NET (Update)

Last time I taught you how to perform a READ operation that retrieves records from a SQL Server database using a .NET application. You can read this tutorial â€“ [Simple .NET Database Tutorial using ADO.NET (Read)][1] if you haven't done yet. This tutorial is still part of a tutorial series entitled "[Simple .NET Database Tutorial using ADO.NET][2]" which aims to teach you how to connect to your SQL Server database and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete).

This part will teach you how to perform an UPDATE method. I strongly suggest that you follow the series in order to make the most out of it. But if you are ready for today's tutorial, go ahead and follow the instructions below.

1\. We are going to continue with the Form we created from[ 'Read' tutorial][1]. Here we just added the controls that is similar to those we created in the first Form.

Since we are going to perform an Update operation. It is better if we can give the user the current values of the records, right? Just drag and drop text boxes, labels and a combo box as shown.

2\. It is considered as best practice to give your Form controls meaningful names. I also added prefixes to their names as a hint to what kind of control each one is. This is not required but rather a convention.

3\. I added a variable named selectedId that will contain the ID of the currently selected Employee. Since I have hidden the ID column (notice the line that sets the visibility of Column 0 to False), we need to save the value of the currently selected Employee in this variable.
