# Connecting To A SQL Server From A .NET Application (and MySQL too)

Connecting to a back-end database is one essential skill in programming (especially when you are building business-oriented apps). Most common back-end database used are SQL Server 2012 and My SQL 5.x.

A quick comparison between the two:

Database
Cost
Pre-requisite
Management

SQL Server 2012
FREE (Express Edition)
None
Management Studio (SSMS)

MySQL 5.6
FREE
.NET Connector
Workbench

Let's start with SQL Server

If you want to play with the latest version of SQL Server (2012 as of this writing), you may download the Express Edition together with its Management Studio [here][3]. If you think that your database won't utilize RAM more than 1 GB and will not take more than 10 GB of disk space, then the Express Edition is already enough for you. For software development, it's more than enough as well. Or you may also want to check [Local DB][4].

On to coding (Don't worry, it's very easy)

What about MySQL?

Did I mentioned that I am going to teach you on how to connect to a MySQL database as well? It is very similar to the steps taken above. Very similar that you only have to change several lines of codes.

But before we go to the changes, make sure that you already have a running [MySQL 5.x][5] and you already installed the required [MySQL .NET Connector][6].

To convert the previous code to it's MySQL counterpart, use the guide below. Reference to the MySQL connection strings can be found [here][7].

Parameter
SQL Server
MySQL

Import Data namespace
using System.Data;
using MySql.Data;

Import Data Client namespace
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using MySql.Data.MySqlClient;

Connection object
SqlConnection cn;
MySqlConnection cn;

Connection string
"Server=.\sqlexpress;Â 

Database=USER;

Trusted_Connection=True;"

"Server=localhost;Â 

Database=USER;

Uid=myUsername;Pwd=myPassword;"



Try it out, if this doesn't work or you found error on my codes, let me know by commenting below and I will reply as soon as possible.
