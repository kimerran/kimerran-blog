# the kimerran logs - 1st Week of August 2012

published: Aug 6, 2012

It's really been raining hard during the week but that doesn't stopped my life. I had my birthday celebration last Saturday August 4, 2012. I invited a lot but only a few came because of the weather.

Trisha came by earlier to help out with the groceries. Des also came a bit earlier to help out with the cooking. Then my cousins Ronnel and Robin. My highschool friends also came â€“ Dave, Adam and Andrew. And Reman, who came 9 PM because he had his masteral classes during the day.

We had great food during the day prepared by my mother, Trisha and Des and me (I also did help during the preparation).Â We had Trisha's Carbonara recipe, Kare-Kare for dinner, fried Tilapia for pulutan, we also ordered [pizza from Yellow Cab][3], fruit salad and barbeque. We had softdrinks, Tanduay Ice and The Bar vodka for drinks.Â Just great spending your birthday with your friends and it's good to be reconnected once again.

Trisha gave me my first ever personal Bible while Des gave me a shirt and shorts set.

It's not only my birthday that was the highlight of the week, during the week (actually last week) it's been my first time to visit Victory The Fort and it was big. It's also the start of a new series called 'That Thing You Do'. I guess I'll be making a blog about my experiences from Victory Sunday services.

Yesterday we went to Victory Pioneer for our Sunday service and it was a great experience as well. We had an early dinner at [Hainanese Delights][8]Â where we ate chicken rice meal combined with their unlimited rice.

I had a great first week of August and looking forward to another great week ahead! Hello Monday!
