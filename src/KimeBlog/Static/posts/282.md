# And Now I am Backing-Up to the Cloud

![Repair and upgrade - 3][1]![Repair and upgrade - 3][2]During the first week of October while I am doing a PC-defrag (using Defraggler), Windows told me that my hard disk drive is dying. It is a Hitachi 750 GB SATA hard drive that comes with my laptop when I bought it last May 2012. So, I panicked.

First, I double-checked using Speccy and it confirmed that my hard disk is having bad days. What I did was I backed up some files in my external hard drive (most are installers and training materials) and some very important files to the CLOUD. I am using Google Drive free account since they give you free 15 GB of cloud storageÂ for one account. Â Currently, most of my important files and pictures are already uploaded there. Recently, I found out that Flickr is now offering 1 TB free storage for your pictures, so I will be migrating the pictures from Google Drive to Flickr soon.

Last weekend I proceed to have my laptop repaired. The power jack is loose so I cannot charge it properly. I also thought of re-formatting it since the last time I did was last May 2012. And, I think when you install your operating system in a VHD, it can add up to the burden of the hard disk making it very slow.

And so what happened is, instead of just having my laptop repaired, I also bought a new hard disk â€“ 1 TB Western Digital and added a new 4 GB RAM to my laptop. Next month, I might buy another 4 GB RAM for a total of 8 GB RAM (if I found the need to do so).

Then my old Hitachi hard drive end up in a hard drive enclosure and now an external portable drive. I performed a reformat and wipe-out on the drive and now the drive is a bit healthier than before.

Lesson learned:

1\. It is still best NOT to install your OS in a virtual hard drive (unless extremely needed)

2\. Back-up your pictures to Flickr (1 TB is pretty big already if you don't store big-sized pictures)

3\. Google Drive will be my first choice for document back-up. 15 GB is also big already for documents.
