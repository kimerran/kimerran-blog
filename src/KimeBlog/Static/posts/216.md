# the kimerran logs - 4th Week of August 2012

published: Aug 28, 2012

Just another regular week at work but the pressure is slowly building since I will be part of one of the biggest project by the team and my part is one of the most important. Well at least I am getting the pace.

This week's my father's birthday last 26th. I bought him new sandals though I was not home to celebrate with them and eat salad and spaghetti. It was the same day I paid for my sister's tuition fee.Â 

The next day, I went to Victory Pioneer with Trisha to attend Sunday service. There's a new series titled 'Ako, Ikaw, Tayo' which is very timely because there are a lot of bad happenings in the country and we Filipinos do not actually act on it.
