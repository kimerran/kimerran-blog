# the kimerran logs - Dub Dub Dub Mania â€“ Likja Creative Solutions

published: Feb 24, 2013

Today, I, Trisha and Des met up to have an exchange of ideas about internet and how one can earn from it. Â I shared a deck of slides I prepared earlier and they said that they have learned a lot though we only had a short time discussing it.

I named my deck â€“ Dub Dub Dub Mania.

My goal is to motivate them and to invite them in joining my future plans. I shared my idea about creating a review/testing platform, an easy-blog platform and many more. I showed them what our group needs â€“ a developer, designer, a content creator, and a social media expert.

Hope they agree with the name I came up with â€“ Likja. From our local language 'malikhain' which means creative.

### Share and Enjoy
