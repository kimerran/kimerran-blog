# the kimerran logs - 13 points in 2013

published: Jul 28, 2012

Here I am listening to music by The Smashing Pumpkins and everytime I listen to '1979â€², I am driven to think about my goals and dreams. Must be because I lived during the 1970â€²s and was reincarnated?

Well, seriously as early as today I am starting my 13 Points in 2013 goals. 13 specific targets that I want to accomplish in 2013. I am writing this before my birthday â€“ a birthday wish to myself I guess.

I have this 1 million peso net worth goal started last year but I am still far from it. My goal this year is 100k and I am only about more than half â€“ mutual fund and a pawned lot in the province.

Since I am a bit inspired today, let's start my 13 goals for next year â€“ "13 Points in 2013â€³

### FINANCIAL ASSETS

Point 13. 200 thousand peso net worth. Though my net worth goal from this year is very far from reality, I am doubling the target for next year.

Point 12. Establish an Emergency Fund. I have been telling everyone that one should have his or her Emergency Fund before diving into investments. I should walk that talk. I am eyeing for BDO on this one since I am iritated to bank with them and this would help me not to touch this fund unless there's an emergency.

Point 11. Invest more. I will target not to miss a month not adding to my mutual fund investment and if budget will allow â€“ to add more including my raise and bonuses.

Point 10. Be consistent with blogging. At least one for each blog a day. I am starting off with this long-term passive investment and must stay consistent. A blog a day will make my day. With this target, I should have at least 365 posts in a year and each article must be worth reading.

HEALTH AND PERSONAL WELLNESS

Point 11. Be fit and right. I have gained weight and must admit I should get back to my old weight so I can use my old clothes too. Gaining weight is quite expensive because you need to buy new clothes. If I have to enroll to a gym program, then so be it.

I am currently doing work-out during MWF in a gym near our office, and the best part is â€“ IT'S FREE!!!

Point 10. Learn how to drive. Yes I am getting old and this skill is a must to learn â€“ even without a car to drive and even if I have to enroll to a driving lesson.

TRAVEL and FOOD

Point 9. Go a place that I've never been. It would be my life's goal to visit a place that I've never been to at least twice a year. One in Visayas and one in Mindanao.

Well, I've never been to Malaysia and I did travel to Visayas last January 2013 to attend a wedding. So, this goal is accomplished! ![:\)][3]![:\)][4]

Point 8. Learn how to cook. I do not know how to cook and this skill will become handy someday. So, will learn how to cook my favorite dishes. Will not enroll in a culinary school but my mother will be my teacher.

CAREER and BUSINESS.

Point 8. Earn a new certification. Since I am stepping again to the development side of IT, might as well get certified. Probably .NET or any web-tech certification.

Point 7. Move up the ladder. Seek for promotion at least a level higher. This will boost up my confidence and will add up to my current skills and experience.

Point 6. Growth for Meme Tees. Meme Tees T-shirts is not only the service but a brand. Looking forward for the growth of sales and production this year.

Point 5. A new business venture. It might be a new product, service or another on-line asset. The important thing is that I will start another one.

RELATIONSHIPS

Point 4. Attend a reunion. It's been a while since I have reconnected with my high school friends. So, if I have to organize one reunion event with them, so be it.

Point 3. Celebrate with the people who needs love more than the others. Christmas or Birthday party with the home-less children, our elders from Home For The Aged or with the juveniles or inmates.

PERSONAL

Point 2. Proceed with the Good Deeds project. I would love to see this soon-to-be service up and running. People will come to visit this site to post something good that will inspire more people to do good and inspire others too.

Point 1. Proceed with the Begin With Me project. Begin with me is like the Good Deeds Project but focuses on sharing your everyday encounter with the Lord.
