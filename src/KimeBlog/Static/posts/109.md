for heaven's sake! im sick and ill-gotten getting the whole report done in engineering lettering. it would take me at least 15 pages of RSI and a minimum of three hours for doing this non-sense assignment. instead of concentrating in other subjects that are "more important", i just wasted my time merely "re-copying" the report plus considering other stuffs like the paper type to be used, the ink, etc. – this is what i call SPOONFEEDING in its most immature form.

how will we learn efficiently if this method of teaching is given more priority? is this the way to teach discipline? maybe… but NOT the only way. what if teaching us more on the subject itself rather than discipline, engineering lettering or handwriting? i thought i already took those subjects.

and if i may add, we have two classes on the same schedule. it may not look like a problem if the two classes aren't using the same laboratory equipment at the same time so one must finish before the other can use it.
i just don't get the point. spare me the undisclosed details. might be troublesome for a graduating student.
