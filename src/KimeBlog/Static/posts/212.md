# the kimerran logs - 2nd Week of August 2012

published: Aug 14, 2012

We are supposed to attend the birthday party this August 11, 2012 of my college classmate, Peter, but we just decided to watch 'The Healing' â€“ a horror movie starred by Vilma Santos and Kim Chiu. The original plan was to watch it at Robinsons Galleria but unfortunately the movie house is full and they cannot accommodate our free pass. So, we went to SM Megamall instead after the confirmation from my sister that it is still showing there. The movie is at 7 o'clock so we had our early dinner at [Classic Savory SM Megamall][1], bought some popcorn at [Kettle Korn][2] and watched the movie. The movie is not really that scary but there are still frightening scenes. After the movie we tried to check out [Happy Lemon's milk tea][3] and we still consider [Gong Cha][4] as the best â€“ at least for us.Â

During Sunday we had our regular grocery routine though I am not feeling well (even right now I am writing it). I also bought the first book in the Song of Ice and Fire series â€“ Game of Thrones.Â Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the Sunday service.
