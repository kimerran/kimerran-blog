# the kimerran logs - Rice in a Box (RBX)

published: Jun 22, 2012

I am very irritated with the customer service with Sun Shop at SM Sucat. I am applying for an additional line for my sister. Last month, I was able to get the same plan within the same day. Actualy, it only took about 2-3 hours from application to the release of the phone from the same branch. However, today that was not the case. The one who process my application told me that I will be informed within 3 days. So, I have my application cancelled at that branch and went to MOA where I got my first line. I was actually called again within the same day, but unfortunately I'm already home when they called. To cut the story short, I got the application approved and got the phone the next day.

Anyway, just did the same routine at MOA to kill time â€“ buy baon for the week. After the usual grocery plus some health stuff (because I will have my medical exam theÂ followingÂ day), I decided to eat merienda at Rice In A Box.

What I ordered is their Beef and Mushroom. My first time to eat RBX was during my college days at the bus terminal near the LRT Central Terminal. I liked the idea because I am always on the go. There was one time when I just took the meal and eat it inside the FX.

Basically, Rice In A Box, is flavored fried rice mixed with Â corn, pea and carrots. It is then put in a paper box where you eat with a spork (spoon and fork).

You can have the Chicken Chorizo or Ham and Bacon for 43 pesos. Beef and Mushroom and Seafood Bagoong at 55 pesos, Beef Teriyaki and Pork BBQ at 59 pesos. While I can really remember if they are offering the Shanghai Meal and Chicken Nuggets meal, they have these additional in their menu for 36 pesos only, hence tagged as 'value meals'. They also have their side dishes like Chicken Nuggets which costs 6 pesos per piece and Fish Burger or Fish Finger for 12 pesos each. Extra rice will cost 12 pesos per order.

As for drinks, they offer Chinese Black Gulaman for 12 pesos for their 12oz and 16 pesos for 16oz.

If you want to munch on an 'affordable-for-the-always-on-the-go' rice meal, you might want to try Rice In A Box.
