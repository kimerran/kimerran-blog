See the picture in my eyes<br/>
Feelings I cannot hide<br/>
Done with the night of cries<br/>
This pain creeping me inside<br/>

Was she worthy of this?<br/>
Was she the one that you would miss?<br/>
Would you grant another kiss?<br/>
Close your eyes, make a wish<br/>

Give me another day<br/>
Color fades with shades of gray<br/>
Film strips are black and white<br/>
To hell share my flight<br/>

Was she worthy of this?<br/>
Was she the one that you would miss?<br/>
Would you grant another kiss?<br/>
Close your eyes, make a wish<br/>

The day end with shades of blue<br/>
Left me here standing cold<br/>
Love you made believe that's true<br/>
Leave me with nothing to hold<br/>

Was she worthy of this?<br/>
Was she the one that you would miss?<br/>
Would you grant another kiss?<br/>
Close your eyes, make a wish<br/>
