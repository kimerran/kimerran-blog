# the kimerran logs - Starting Another Chapter

published: Jul 31, 2012

The two days of my orientation are done and tomorrow will be my first day with my team. I am starting yet another chapter in my life and I guess I will be staying with my new company for a while.

I am inspired and motivated again and I am now following what my heart really tells me to do â€“ to develop and code some stuff.

Hoping that this will be another great experience for me. Let's begin!
