# the kimerran logs - 2nd Week of December 2012

published: Dec 10, 2012

Hello! Two weeks before Christmas! Yesterday, I went to Christmas Party of First Food Link â€“ a processed meat direct-selling business held at Max's Quezon Avenue. It was fun and all people got their presents. The business looks promising and I might try it with the help of my mother.

Last week I gave my parents a treat â€“ a one-hour whole body massage from Vibes at SM Sucat. Today, they went to watch Pacquiao-Marquez 4 live at SM Cinema. Badnews is, Pacquaio lost the bout. And that begins a 'cyber-war' between Philippines and Mexico over Twitter and other online social media.

Tomorrow I have a bout of my own, finally my project will take its pilot phase. Wish me luck! ![:D][1]

PS. I am creating a new blog dedicated to [Windows Phone][4] stuff, stay tuned!
