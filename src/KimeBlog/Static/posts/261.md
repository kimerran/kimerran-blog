# the kimerran logs - A Visit to the Petronas Twin Towers

published: Jul 27, 2013

During my first week in Malaysia I have decided to pay a visit to the iconic Petronas Twin Towers (Menara Petronas). I think your tour or visit in Malaysia could not be complete without at least visiting one of the world's tallest skyscrapers.

Petronas is a Malaysian oil and gas company who is responsible for managing the country's own oil resources. The Petronas towers serves as the headquarters of the company and was the tallest building in the world from 1998 to 2004 until Taipei 101 was built.

I woke up around 7 o'clock in the morning and went to KL Sentral Station. From there, you need to ride an LRT â€“ Kelana Jaya line to KLCC Station. The train ride costs 1 ringgit only. You just need to get token from the vending machine if you don't have the Touch N Go card.

KLCC Station exit is actually located at the bottom of Menara Petronas. If you are on a budget trip, you can walk around the area or visit Suria Mall and go window shopping. But if you have money to spare, you can get a Sky Bridge tour for RM 80. The visitors comes by batch and the management sells limited number of tickets per day. It is also on a first-come, first-served basis so the ticket I bought was already for the 2:15 PM batch.

So, I just went to Suria Mall and kill some time by window shopping and by watching a movie for seven ringgit only. You can also visit the Science Discovery center or if you are hungry, you can try some Malaysian foods at the food court.

At least 10 minutes before your scheduled visit (indicated in your ticket), you should go to the check-in area where you will be oriented about the tour. There is a short video presentation shown before you are lead by the tour guide to the lift.

The tour includes at least 15 minutes stay on the Sky Bridge (I forgot which floor it is located) and another 15-20 minutes stay on the observation deck. Here's a short video clip taken from the Sky Bridge.

A friend has mentioned that it is better to visit by night since the towers are lit up and it is really a great view. Maybe next time I'll visit at night to see for myself.

Here's some pictures inside the Petronas Twin Towers
