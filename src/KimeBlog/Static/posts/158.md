# the kimerran logs - Dairy Queen Blizzard Butterfinger and Kitkat

published: Jun 7, 2012

After treating my friend for lunch because of a 'favor', Trisha and I went to DQ at Glorietta 4 for dessert. We ordered Blizzard â€“ the original DQ served smooth blended with your favorite chocolates, cookies or fruits. And if it's not served upside-down, it's free. I chose the butterfinger while Trisha had the kitkat.

Since I'm pretty full that time, I just ordered the small one while Trisha had the large one. ![:P][1]
