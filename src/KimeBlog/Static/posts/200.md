# the kimerran logs - RBX: Rice In A Box MRT Ayala

published: Jul 26, 2012

Rice in a Box or RBX as what they are usually called features rice meal put in a paper box. This has clicked to mass market in the Philippines since Filipinos are rice-eatersÂ One selling factor of this product is the being 'on-the-go' that most people on the working sector and as well as students would definitely love.

I had my first taste of RBX during my college years when I forgot to take lunch and was very hungry. After buying a serving of rice-in-a-box, I ate it inside the cab on my way home.

### The Rice in a Box Experience

Dinner time! And Trisha wanted to try out RBX at MRT Ayala so we ate there. She had Teriyaki while I had Seafood Bagoong. It was Trisha's first time to eat rice-in-a-box meal.

The teriyaki was placed in a bowl instead of a box.Â The supposed to be 'spicy' seafood bagoong was not really spicy at all but I still enjoyed the meal.

### Income Opportunity
