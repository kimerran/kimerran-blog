# Windows Phone Dev Account Now for Only $19

![windows phone developer account][1]![windows phone developer account][2]Three months ago, Microsoft ran a promotion for Windows-Phone-Dev-wannabeesÂ (like me) and slash 80% off the original price of $100 for a year of Windows Phone Developers account. This promo ran from June 26, 2013 to August 27, 2013.

The good news is â€“ the price tag of $19 is now permanent. You can register any time of the year for only $19. This is even cheaper than [Google's Play Developer Console Account][3]Â which is currently at $25Â and now cheaper than [iOS Developer Program][4]Â at $99 per year of subscription.

Good Move by Microsoft

Given that Windows Phone is behind Google's Android and Apple's iOS platforms, I think this is a good move by Microsoft. Now, more developers will try to get their feet wet to create applications for Windows Phone.
