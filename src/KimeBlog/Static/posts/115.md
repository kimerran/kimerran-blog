I write and I'm lost. Confused and again hopeless.
Listening to semi-sad songs with happy melodies.
Her smile is like my defeat. Pointless.
Confused to this scenario.
Yes-I don't know what to do.
I want an adventure, a risk-driven friendship but no romantic affairs – at most.
She wants mega-ultimate-super-ultra friendship – no more, can be less.

I'm afraid I cannot express myself well in this entry like I can't express myself to her.
Me no understand my self too – see?
We got a bunch of some stupid and some pointless stuffs people call "similarities".
Maybe I still don't know myself – Hello me. I am me. How are me?

If she don't want.
Then my stupid me got no choice.
Here I am – the one with no options but to stare at the line that she drew between us.
Will fantasy exist in my hell? I don't believe in heaven nor hell.
Reality nor dreams.
But I'm sick and tired and sick and tired and sick and tired but sometimes happy of being me – alone.
He wants she. She wants nobody.
I guess that's it. Just another leaf.
Turn another page. Maybe the next chapter.
"Stuck up on a effin day…" – Stuck up on a date.

Hate to be stuck… Somebody get me outta here.
