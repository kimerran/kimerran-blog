# the kimerran logs - Gong Cha Glorietta

published: Jul 26, 2012

While we kill some time, we just had our favorite milk tea at Glorietta. The glass is taller than G5, it took some time before we finished it.

Before you sip when mixed, try to taste the cream-thing on top, then sip after you fill your mouth â€“ taste like heaven. I believe that's the proper way to enjoy this milk tea.
