# the kimerran logs - Celebrating 2nd Anniversary

published: Nov 28, 2012

Just celebrated our 2nd year anniversary last November 28, 2012. 2 years of our relationship and it getting stronger. I've created a simple video to greet my girlfriend.

Since there are a lot of financial challenges coming over me, we decided to keep our celebration simple for this year. The original plan was to check out Wensha's spa but Trisha read a bad news from the internet so we opted to try Ton-ton Massage instead. We tried their whole body thai massage and it was really great. Our stresses suddenly left our body after the massage.

It was really relaxing and we'll probably be back. After that, we had a simple dinner at Glorietta and brought her a new pink bag. She really liked it.

Once again, Happy 2nd anniversary!!! ![:\)][1]
