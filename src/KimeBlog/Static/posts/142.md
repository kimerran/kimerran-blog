# the kimerran logs - renewing my dreams

recently i passed my first certification exam. it was a dream during my college days. even after college, i dreamed of being certified in a chosen filed. during my stay at narrasystems, i worked with networking technologies. we studied whats and hows of it. we studied networking protocols (hardcore). i even had the chance to play with high-end cisco routers and switches. i even had the chance to read thick cisco study guides. i practiced using simulators. we had trainings during the night after work. and even in my first ever job as a software development engineer, i have to know these networking technology. and from there, i made a decision to become a ccna someday. or even ccie. from there, i looked for review materials. i read ccna books from our office. hands-on with gns3 at home. i created kimerranlab. i learned how to create virtual routers. even virtual networks. ccna costs a lot. and i don't know if i really want to pursue this dream. who knows? maybe someday.

servers and networks work hand-in-hand. these two make IT today. these two makes the world wide web. these two makes business. these two is what makes our everyday life. and so, i am also interested in learning the server technologies particularly microsoft servers. start with windows server 2003 and 2008. will continue with exchange server, sharepoint server and even virtualization technologies. i already began reading a lot about these topics. i watch cbt nuggets and train signal training videos. i have a lot of ebooks about it. call me a geek but i want to be a master in these technologies someday. and considering that technology is very fast changing.

at present, i am working with hewlett-packard philippines as an ITO (infrastructure technology operations) service delivery consultant under workplace services tower. i am a technical support specialist in hp client automation enterprise software (formerly radia from novadigm). we do patch and inventory management to Panasonic worldwide. i also troubleshoot problems with their client automation software. and with regards to administration, i automate some of my routine tasks.

i am on a career planning stage right now. i want to plan it very well. what i really wanted to be someday is to design an it infrastructure of a company. i want to start with a role in operations. maybe monitoring and maintenance of a certain company's IT infrastructure. i want to be an IT architect. an IT engineer. an IT project manager. for as long as i will lead a team for that particular project. with proper skills and knowledge with present technologies and of course experience, i can and i will be that dream.

then maybe, just maybe, i will be a certified architect or certified master. looking forward in ten to twenty years. wish me well. i have the dream, i just have to live it. ![:\)][1]
