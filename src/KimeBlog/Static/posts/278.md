# the kimerran logs - No more five more minutes

published: Sep 17, 2013

This could mean being 2 hours late for work. But doesn't apply to me since my work is about 5-10 minutes walk from the condominium I am staying (about 3 minutes if I run, but haven't tried so not very sure).

What's making me busy? Well, something I never thought of doing. Windows Phone XNA game and it's made in C#. I am also writing my first Windows Phone app which should be finished in a few weeks from now after I am done with the XNA game.

Note: XNA is not anymore supported by Microsoft (at least not in active development). But you may want to check out something called MonoGame which is a game framework that can enable you to make games in almost all popular platforms such as iOS and Android.

Meanwhile, it's like Sun Cellular (a mobile network in the Philippines) is making a fun of me.[ #poorcustomerservice][1] as my former colleague says.
