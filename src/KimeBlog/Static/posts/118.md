why do some people still ignore me? need not to be sad on this one but i wanna know the reasons why. i approach them well. greet them nice. and stay positive towards them. but still – no response.

regarding our project. we are more than hopeless. i just cant figure it out so we setting on plan B. but plan B is not 100% acceptable – for now. i have to make CCV work with MultiTouch Vista and Windows 7. Oh God..Pls help me and my groupmates. documentation on-going. i wish we can make it. this is terrible.

review for the year. i like how the year started. but to end it this way – not cool. so i just look back what happened during the early months of 2009.

Pfizer internship. met few friends here. internship experience is an A+. got excited as 5th year student. im always wishin to be one – but now i wish im a freshman. first semester is crazy. a lot of projects = a lot of stress. i also had reunions with my ASA-AdU family and Integ family this year. but i was not present during integ's xmas party (so busy with project). got my copy of the latest microsoft OS – windows 7 RC and now windows 7 professional (free). we got internet-connected at the later part of the year so i played ragnarok online again. one my best online games for me. at first i tried Philippine RO at valkyrie server. but after a while, i played LimitRO and still part of its community. war of emperium first experience. with SchlagSahne, then Affliction then now LoveBeat. i also met online friends here. some filipinos some german, canadian, and asians.
