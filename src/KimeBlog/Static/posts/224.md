# the kimerran logs - 3rd and 4th Week of September

published: Oct 2, 2012

I've been busy during the last two weeks so this post is a bit late. At work I've been busy with my project which is one of our main projects and I am leading the team with it. I am also assigned to teach them VB.NET since I am the only team resource that knows .NET programming.Â 

During the weekends I also do programming in PHP since I am helping my girlfriend with their project. I was also able to meet my co-officers in ACOES, Jao and Lance since Lance is my girlfriend's groupmate.

Another thing that keeps me busy is learning new .NET technologies such as WCF and WF which I might use in my future projects. I am also learning CSharp since we might use it in the next projects as well.

During the weekends I slept over at my girlfriend's house and helped her with her assignment in Assembly language. That really makes my head hurt since I am no master of that language and moving around high and low-level programming is a pain in the a-s-s.

We also celebrated my sister's 17th birthday at home and she brought some of her friends too.
