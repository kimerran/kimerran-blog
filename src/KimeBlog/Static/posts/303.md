Been working on several stuffs lately. Just thought of creating my own WordPress theme for this blog plus new skill too. Here's what I finished so far.

![I did this by myself][2]

Still thinking if I will move both Money Gizmo and Gizmo Blogr to this one domain. PROs would be cheaper cost of maintenance but it could affect my existing SEO standing (especially for Money Gizmo). One thing's for sure, I will transfer Sisig Bytes to this domain.

Still a work in progress.
