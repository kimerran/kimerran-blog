# the kimerran logs - Minor Change of Plans

published: Mar 23, 2013

Don't you dare store a lot of files across thousands of directories on your SHARED hosting account. So, I already created a backup of my FOR REMOVAL sitesâ€¦ Those sites that are mistakenly created and snatched me some money from my wallet. Anyway that's a bit big and with my current internet connection speed â€“ I cannot download it â€¦ yet.

Anyway, I am thinking of creating another site â€“ internetgizmo.com â€“ about web development and SEO. I am thinking if the competition is quiet high or should I do this out of hobby? Probably the 2nd answer might do since that is the real long-term goal for authority sites.

Minor change of plans

1\. Focus on MG first. I want to see it catching up some $$$ first before I go to the next $i$igbytes and MFI â€“ which is basically an experiment on micro-nice/SEO.

2\. I MIGHT buy internetgizmo.com before someone else does (cause I might have the .net again)

3\. Improve SB and MFI on low priority. At least edit and add 1 article per WEEK! for both sites.

4\. Klasmeyt.COM might not push through yet.

5\. Likja.COM will be a waste of money for now. So NO.
