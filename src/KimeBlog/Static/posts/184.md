# the kimerran logs - Kenny Rogers Roasted Chicken Solo

published: Jul 10, 2012

It's time to feed our hungry stomachs again and we decided that it would be Kenny Rogers' this time. You can find one at Glorietta 4 2nd Floor when you are around the Makati area.

We ordered the 'Chicken Solo' meal. You can either choose whether you want one side dish, two side dish or just a full-set meal.

You can also choose what sauce you want â€“ BBQ, peppercorn (which I really like) and creamy mushroom.

I had a chicken salad for the side dish while Trisha had macaroni and mashed potato (her favorite).

Chicken Solo meal from Kenny Rogers will cost you 175 pesos for one side dish, 199 for two side dish. We had a regular sized four-seasons that costs 45 pesos each.

Oops I almost forgot, their muffin (which came for free) is superb!
