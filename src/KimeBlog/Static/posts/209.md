# the kimerran logs - July 2012 Monthsary

published: Jul 31, 2012

This is yet another late post from me but let me just tell you a short story about what happened during our July 2012 monthsary. [Trisha][1] and I areÂ now 1 year and 8 months.

July 28, Saturday. We met at Metropoint EDSA and we are supposed to experience a massage by blind persons but we did not. I bought her a bag from the novelty shop there and had buko shake too. We will celebrate the monthsary this month without spending a lot that we decided to watch a downloaded movie at their house. Before we went to there house, we bought Chooks To Go which we will devour on dinner.Â We watched the Invention of Lying. I spend the night at their house.

The following day we went to Victory (The Fort) to attend to Sunday service. The topic is very interesting and it really pushes me now to read the Bible and to learn and live with it. Unfortunately I do not have yet my own Bible but I guess I will buy one tomorrow.

After the service, we went to Market-Market. I bought a new slacks and belt since I have only one black slacks and I really feel wearing one now on my new role. We had merienda/early dinner at [Shakey's][2] and ordered her favorite carbonara. We had a platter since she says it's more sulit (economical) than if we ordered two solo's, we had also her favorite mojos 'n dip and my favorite mango juice.

It really doesn't end there although the weather is not really nice and the rain's pouring hard. We plan to go to SM Bicutan to buy some Kettle Korn but unfortunately we can't find a jeep going there so we went to SM MOA instead and bought there. She took a jeep home and a rode an FX.

Looking forward to more love celebrations with my one and only Trisha.
