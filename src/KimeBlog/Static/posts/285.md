# ASP.NET MVC 4 Video Tutorials

![ASPNET MVC 4][1]![ASPNET MVC 4][2]Currently I am studying ASP.NET MVC and have plans on taking [70-486 (Developing ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Applications)][3] maybe next year if I feel confident enough. I think that in order to pass any certification exam, you need real-life hands-on experience of the technology you are being tested. Unfortunately, my role now doesn't have anything to do with MVC so I am building my own applications using MVC during free time.

Aside from reading books and articles about it, there is an available series from Channel 9. Channel 9 is like a YouTube of all Microsoft-related technologies. If you are looking for tutorials and want to learn stuff about everything Microsoft, that's the first place to look for.

Here's the series -Â [Developing ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Applications][4] which you can also watch from Channel 9 but I am posting it here for my own reference.

Full course outline:

Mod 01: Introduction to MVC 4
Mod 02: Developing ASP.NET MVC 4 Models
Mod 03: Developing MVC 4 Controllers
Mod 04: Developing ASP.NET MVC 4 Views
Mod 05: Integrating JavaScript and MVC 4
Mod 06: Implementing Web APIs
Mod 07: Deploying to Windows Azure
Mod 08: Visual Studio 2013/MVC 5 Sneak Peek
