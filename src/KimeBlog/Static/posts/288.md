# Working with Git in Visual Studio 2013

Just recently found out that Visual Studio 2013 now supports Git repositories. GitÂ is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed ([from Wikipedia][1]).

This articles will show you how to connect to your git repository, clone it to your local machine, make some changes and then commit and sync it to your remote repository â€“ all inside Visual Studio. Sounds easy right, yes!

1\. First, let's open the Team Explorer pane by navigating to File > Open > Open from Source Control

2\. The Team Explorer will open and you will see list of TFS repositories or Git repositories

3\. Now we are ready for cloning. First, get the URL of your remote Git repository. If you are using GitHub, you can find it at the lower right portion from your repository page.

4\. Click on Clone from the Team Explorer pane and enter the URL taken from Step 3. The second line is the location where you want to save (clone) the copy of your repository.

Â 

5\. Once you click Clone, it will copy all files from your remote repository (in my case, GitHub) to your local machine.

Â 

6\. Once cloning is successful, it will show a success message and your repository will now be added to the list.

Â 

7\. Double-click the repository name that you want to work on. It will now show the Home page of your chosen repository.

8\. On the lower part of the repository's home page, you will find Solutions. Now, double-click the solution that you want to open. At this point, all projects that are part of the chosen solution will be opened.

9\. Now, let's do some modification. You will notice that Visual Studio recognizes that the file was edited by putting a yellow mark on the left side of the screen and the file that I edited has now a redÂ check symbol in the Solution Explorer.

Â 

10\. To commit the files to your git repository, right click on the file then select Commit.

Â 

11\. Provide a descriptive message on what modifications has been made. This will help you and your team keep track of changes on your repository.

Â 

12\. Clicking on the drop-down arrow will provide you three options on how you wanted to commit your changes.

* Commit â€“ only saves to your local repository
* Commit and Push â€“ saves to your local and push changes to your remote repository
* Commit and Sync â€“ saves to your local and push changes to your remote repository and then pull any latest modification from the remote repository to your local copy

Â 

13\. That's all! You can verify if you were able to push successfully the changes made by checking on your remote repository.
