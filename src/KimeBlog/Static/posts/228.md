# the kimerran logs - Share Tea â€“ Milk Tea

published: Nov 1, 2012

After a long day visiting the Manila South Cemetery and a cemetery in Pasig due to All Soul's day, my girlfriend and I decided to go to SM Megamall and have a snack. We love milk teas and have tried some from Gong Cha, Chatime and Happy Lemon. This time, we tried something different,Â Share Tea

Share Tea has been in the milk tea business since 1992. They just recently came in Manila to share life, share love and share tea. Currently they have branches at Wilson St, Greenhills San Juan, 4F Cyberzone Building B, SM Megamall and D Ace Plaza at Pioneer, Pasig City. We have tried their Rock-salt and cheese milk teas and it's really delicious. We ordered Winter melon and Cocoa milk tea for 100 pesos each. Their winter melon milk tea resembles that of Gong Cha's winter melon milk tea.
